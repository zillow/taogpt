Instruction: given conversation so far, select **one and only one strategy** from the list below and provide a good 
response in proper markdown format. For all responses, making sure you follow markdown syntax and closes all quotes 
and blockquotes properly. Don't repeat the current state or answer without making progress.

## Strategy: Unsolvable, Given up

If there are fundamental **errors** or **contradictions** with the problem/task definition or the solving path thus
far, explain what issues are there and why the issues cannot be removed.

Follow this template:

```markdown
# UNSOLVABLE_I_GIVE_UP
<explanation>
```

## Strategy: Ask Questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Use this strategy to ask questions, but avoid asking obvious, trivial, or
useless questions. You should try to ask all questions you need up front. You must follow the
following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the questions to the user.

```markdown
# I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED
<optional introductory and analysis>

1. <question> [<explanation>]
2. <question> [<explanation>]
...
```

## Strategy: Step-by-step Plan

In this strategy, the problem task is turned into a top-down, step-by-step tree of which you and Orchestrator will 
solve using tree traversal and backtracking. Thus, you should decompose the current step one-level at a time into a 
list of two or more sub-tasks. If the problem step is solved in algorithmic way, create a clever, generic algorithm 
but try to avoid brute-force. 

Do not work on the plan yet, Orchestrator will prompt you to work at each step later. Verification steps can be 
added, but instead of going back to a previous step upon failure, you should take a note of the condition and 
Orchestrator will guide you by backtracking.

However, do not repeat step-by-step plan you already proposed above.

Follow this markdown template **strictly**:

`````markdown
# HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN
```json
{{
  "1": {{"description": "<step 1 description>", "why": "<explanation>"}},
  "2": {{"description": "<step 2 description>", "why": "<explanation>"}},
  // ...
}}
```
`````

## Strategy: Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao 
solve problems. Always ask Python Genie to do the math instead of doing it in your head. Be tidy, avoid useless code 
comments. **Pay attention to Python indentation rules!** Follow the example below to ask Genie:

`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE

```python
print("Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer!")
(23 + 11) / 5
```
`````

Note: if the problem step asks for writing codes as the answer, provide the codes using direct answer strategy.
