{intent} Report errors and warnings found, but avoid nitpicking, in this format:

At step#<ID>: <step description>: <issue found and reason>. Severity: `error` or `warning`. 
    Already fixed in subsequentstep: yes/no;
    Recommendation: <any suggestion>.
...
At step#<ID>: affected by issue found at step#<previous ID>: <step description>.

where `"step#<ID>: <step description>"` can be found in the bracket "[at step#<ID>: <step_description>]" of the steps 
(without the brackets.)

Directions:

* For any step, do NOT report issues that should be taken care of by different step or step plan. For
  example, dummy/placeholder/temporary values that are to be taken care of later.
* For any step, do NOT report issues that are already taken care of in subsequent/affected steps.
* We should generally respect user's assumptions even if they are inaccurate as assumptions are meant to simplify
  the problem.
* Subsequent steps depending on the issue should be reported an step as `affected by` only if it must be
  changed or fixed; if a step depends on this step but not on the particular issue, no need to report.
