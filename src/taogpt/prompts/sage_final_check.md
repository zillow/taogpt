Is the solution correct? Please come up with as many applicable items to verify as you can, carefully verify each 
item, determine severity of issues, and identify steps responsible for errors and warnings. Do NOT report 
intermittent errors that have been fixed in the solution chain; correctness of the final answer is what the user wants.
We should generally respect user's assumptions even if they are inaccurate as assumptions are meant to simplify the 
problem. Respond using the following JSON template:

```json
{
  "<what to verify>": {
    "error": "<something incorrect, subsequent steps not impacted or fixable>", 
    "content": "<content snippet related to the issue",
    "blame": "<step#>: <step description>",
    "affecting": ["<step#>: <step description>", "<step#>: <step description>", ...]
  },
  "<what to verify>": {
    "warning": "<something can be improved>",
    "content": "<content snippet related to the issue",
    "blame": "<step#>: <step description>"
  },
  "<what to verify>": {"ok": "<this looks good>"},
  // ...
}
```

where `"<step#>: <step description>"` can be found in the bracket "[at step#<num>: <step_description>]" of the steps 
(without the brackets.)

If a blamed step wrote/updated a file, also blame subsequent steps updating that file.
