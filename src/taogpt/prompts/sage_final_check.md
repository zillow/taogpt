Is the solution correct? Please come up with as many applicable things to verify as you can, extract relevant 
content, if any, for  each item, carefully verify each item. Respond using the following JSON template:

```json
{
  "<verify step 1>": {
    "content": "<extract relevant content>", "error": "<something is incorrect>"
  },
  "<verify step 2>": {
    "content": "<extract relevant content>", "warning": "<something can be improved>",
  },
  "<verify step 2>": {"ok": "<all good>"},
  // ...
}
