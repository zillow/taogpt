Tao, the above is your final problem solving trajectory. Present a final answer to the user. The user would not read 
the problem solving session, so make sure to include **full and complete** reasoning details except files, unless 
requested by the task problem otherwise. Include codes and outputs executed by Python Genie if necessary.

Do NOT write out or repeat any file contents. All files created during the session (with the `### FILE <path>` heading) 
will be saved by the Orchestrator.
