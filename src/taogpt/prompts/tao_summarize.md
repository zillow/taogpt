Present the **final complete answer** to the user. If the task specifically requests certain form or format, obey the 
request; otherwise, provide reasoning details including relevant codes or content snippets, except 
files (those under `### FILE:` headings) as they will be saved by the Orchestrator. Goal is to **present** result; 
do NOT over-summarize; do NOT repeat file contents. Avoid phatic expressions.
