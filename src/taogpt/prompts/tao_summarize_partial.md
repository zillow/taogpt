Summarize results between {from_step} to {to_step}, **excluding** updated files (the `FILE:` sections, which they are
consolidated separately). Fix any errors you may find. Be sure to keep all key information as details from these steps will be
hidden, but avoid mentioning the from-to steps (as they won't be known hereafter). Avoid phatic expressions.
