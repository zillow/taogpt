Please fix the issues and rewrite the **full** answer adding brief notes of what you fixed. If you disagree with the 
critic, explain with additional notes. Orchestrator and user would not see the previous edits, so unchanged contents 
should be repeated verbatim. Do not add any phatic expressions.
