Please fix the issues and rewrite the **full** answer adding brief notes of what you fixed. 

1. Fix the issues to satisfaction with real changes; try your best and don't ignore or make phantom changes. 
2. Orchestrator and user would not see the previous edits, so unchanged contents should be repeated verbatim. 
   Explanation of changes should be incorporated into any original explanation.
3. However, do not introduce other contents/changes not in the original answer unless it is affecred by the reported 
   issues. 
4. If you disagree with the reported issue or find no need to change anything, then respond with `No change because of <explanation>`.
5. Do not add any phatic expressions.
6. Do NOT update other steps, as we've already fixed them. Update only [step#{step_id}: {step}].
