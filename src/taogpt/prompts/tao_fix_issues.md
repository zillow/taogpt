Please fix the issues and rewrite the **full** answer adding brief notes of what you fixed. Fix the issues to 
satisfaction, don't ignore. If you disagree with the critic, explain with additional notes. Orchestrator and user 
would not see the previous edits, so unchanged contents should be repeated verbatim. Do not add any phatic expressions.
