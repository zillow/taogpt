## Ask questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Ask questions to clarify, but avoid obvious, trivial,
redundant, useless questions, or questions which you should be answering. You should try to ask all questions you
need up front. You must follow the following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the
questions to the user. Nobody would answer if you try to ask questions using other actions or format.
