## Ask questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Ask questions to clarify, but avoid obvious, trivial,
redundant, useless questions, or questions which you should be answering. You should try to ask all questions you
need up front. You must follow the following template:

```markdown
I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED:
<optional introductory and analysis>

1. <question>
2. <question>

```
