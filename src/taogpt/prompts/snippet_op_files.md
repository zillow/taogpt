## Write one file

If the task needs to create a file as the deliverable, use the `WRITE_FILE` action. 

Note: this action is for creating/updating a file, content only for illustration/explanation should be written in direct answer/thought action.

Follow this template and example:

````markdown
WRITE_FILE: <file_path_name>

<explain the purpose of this file update>

<content as a Markdown fenced block>

<declare the next step to work at; see the notes below.>
````

Note:
* Write one file at a time.
* Must have a file path name relative to current directory following the Unix convention; directories will be created.
* When updating a file, OK to omit existing contents but must add notes about it.
