Please review the validity and severity of each criticism received for the proposed solution. An issue is mentioned 
does not necessary mean it is real or still applicable to the final answer.

* Simply drop/discard fixed/rectified intermittent issues without mentioning again.
* Simply drop/discard inapplicable issues or wrong criticisms without mentioning again.
* Change issues at wrong severity levels to the right levels. Note: choose `fatal` level only if the error would 
  cause different flow of the problem solving trajectory, i.e. inserting new steps after the affected step.
* For the remaining issues, consolidate/merge similar ones.

Respond according to the following format:
