Review criticisms received and summarize into a JSON fenced block:

```json
{
  "<what to verify>": {
    "error": "<issue with reason; and any recommendation>",
    "blame": "step#<ID>: <step description>",
    "fixed_in_subsequent_step": true or false,
    "affecting": ["step#<ID>: <step description>", "step#<ID>: <step description>", ...]
  },
  "<what to verify>": {
    "warning": "<something can be improved with reasoning and recommendation>",
    "blame": "step#<ID>: <step description>",
    "fixed_in_subsequent_step": true or false
  },
  "<what to verify>": {"ok": "<this looks good>"},
  // ...
}
```

Ignore issues that are fixed in subsequent steps. If everything is OK, return empty JSON hash.
