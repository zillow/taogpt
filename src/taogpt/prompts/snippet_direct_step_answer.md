## Strategy: Direct Answer

Go with this strategy if you know the correct answer. Choose the `HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN` strategy instead if you 
have a step-by-step answer. You should also tell the Orchestrator which step you want to work at next in 
the `### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

`````markdown
# MY_THOUGHT
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content section only in need of writing a file>

### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT:
<step description> or "None. This is the final step."
`````
