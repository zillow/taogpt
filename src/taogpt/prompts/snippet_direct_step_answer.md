## Answer directly

Just answer directly if the task step is simple. You should also tell the Orchestrator which step you want to work 
at next in the `### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

`````markdown
# MY_THOUGHT
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content section only in need of writing a file>

### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT:
<step description> or "None. This is the final step."
`````
