# IS_TAO_STILL_ON_THE_GOOD_PATH?

The above are the proposals or partial solutions Tao has provided. 

Some critics claim there are these issues:

* there are fundamental errors in the original task problem preventing it from being solved.
* Tao's solving path steps or answer so far likely lead to a dead-end or an infinite loop.
* Tao's partial answers contain errors or in invalid states.

Other critics claim everything is fine.

Given problem definition and the current state of execution, are we still on good track to solve the task problem? 

Note: a `THIS_CANNOT_BE_SOLVED` answer is acceptable if it is indeed true.

Respond using the following template including newlines and put explanation inside the brackets:

```markdown
[analysis and explanation]

true_or_false
```

Then write `false` if any of issues above applies. Only when all look good, and you can respond with `true`.

Think carefully before responding.
