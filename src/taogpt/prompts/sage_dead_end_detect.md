# IS_TAO_STILL_ON_THE_GOOD_PATH?

The above are the proposals or partial solutions Tao has provided. Given problem definition and the current state of 
execution, are we still on good track to solve the task problem? 

Carefully check these issues:

* If there are fundamental issues with the original task definition that can't be fixed?
* Will Tao's solving path steps so far likely lead to a dead-end or an infinite loop?
* do the partial answers or scratchpad records contain any errors or are in invalid states?

Respond using the following template including newlines and put explanation inside the brackets:

true_or_false
```

Then write `false` if any of issues above applies. Only when all look good, and you can respond with `true`.
