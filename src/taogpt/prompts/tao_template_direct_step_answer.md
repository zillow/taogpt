##### Strategy: **I_WILL_ANSWER_THIS_STEP_DIRECTLY**:
Go with this strategy if the step is simple and you know the correct answer. You should also tell the Orchestrator 
which step you want to work at next in the `NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Important Note: if this is the **final answer** to the whole problem, then go with the "MY_FINAL_ANSWER" strategy 
below instead of this strategy.

Follow this template:

```markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_THIS_STEP_DIRECTLY
<answer and explanation>

### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT:
<description of the next step>
```

##### Strategy: **MY_FINAL_ANSWER**:

If you're done and able to summarize and provide your solution for the **whole problem**, double check your solutions 
and make sure following the task's output requirements.

```markdown
# MY_FINAL_ANSWER
<your final full answer to the task>
```
