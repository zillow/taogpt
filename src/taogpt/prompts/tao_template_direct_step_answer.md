## Strategy: Direct Answer

Go with this strategy if the step is simple and you know the correct answer. You should also tell the Orchestrator 
which step you want to work at next in the `NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section. If you need to write out any file
contents, write out the content in markdown fenced code block under its own file section. If you are writing out a 
file, do not repeat its content in the "answer and explanation" section. Do not repeat a previous written file unless 
you are updating its content.

Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

```markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<brief description of this file>

<file content in markdown fenced code block>

### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT:
<next step ID: description> or "None. This is the final step."
```
