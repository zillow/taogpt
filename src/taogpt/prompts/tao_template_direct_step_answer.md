## Strategy: Direct Answer

Go with this strategy if you know the correct answer. You should also tell the Orchestrator which step you want to 
work at next in the `### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

`````markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content section only in need of writing a file>

### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT:
<next step ID: description> or "None. This is the final step."
`````
