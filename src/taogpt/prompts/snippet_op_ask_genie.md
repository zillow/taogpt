## Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao
solve problems. It's stateful and previously defined globals can be used without redefining.

Follow the good example below to ask Genie:

`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE
<brief explanation of what the code snippet is for>

```python
def fib(n):
    return fib(n-1) + f(n-2) if n > 1 else 1
print(f"Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer! Here is the answer {{fib(22)}}")
```

<declare the next step to work at; see the notes below.>
`````

1. Not paying attention to Python indentation.
2. The code comment is redundant; avoid useless comments
