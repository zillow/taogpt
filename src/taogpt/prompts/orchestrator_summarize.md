Tao, the above is your final problem solving trajectory. Please summarize it to a final answer.

Note: this is the final answer presented to the user. Therefore make sure to include **full and complete** 
information requested by the user, except file contents, but leave out details created during the solving session that 
the user do not need. If you use any files written during the problem solving above, to save spaces, you don't need 
to repeat the file contents; instead you can refer to the files by path as `file:file_name_path`.
