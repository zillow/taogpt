Tao, the above is your final problem solving trajectory. Please summarize it to a final answer.

Note: if you use any files written during the problem solving above, to save spaces, you don't need to repeat the file 
contents; instead you can refer to the files by path as `file:file_name_path`, for example: 

```markdown
The python program you need is contained in the files:

1. file:my_module/__init__.py
2. file:my_module/main.py
```
