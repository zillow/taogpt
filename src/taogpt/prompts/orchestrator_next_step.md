Which step you want to work on next? You can choose one of two options below.

1) Finish the task with the final answer:

    If there's nothing more to do, provide the final answer and summary using the following 
    template:
    
    ```markdown
    # FINAL_ANSWER
    <summarize your final answer>
    ```

2) Finish the task by giving up:

    If you hit the dead-end, you can give up solving the problem and Orchestrator will help you try different alternatives:
    
    ```markdown
    # UNSOLVABLE_I_GIVE_UP
    <Some explanation>
    ```

3) Choose the next step to work on:

    You can choose the next step and get start working on it using the following template. You're encouraged to 
    choose from the steps planned earlier but you can also take a detour from the earlier plan.
    
    ```markdown
    # NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT
    <step description>
    
    <strategy for the next step>
    ```
    
    Follow the strategy-selection instruction above for the details of the next step. Example:
    
    ```markdown
    # NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT
    get_a_random_even_number
    
    ## I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
    42
    ```
