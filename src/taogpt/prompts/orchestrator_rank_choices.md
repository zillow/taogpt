Tao has proposed the following different approaches:

{approaches}

---

Based on proposed problem solving approaches, the state of execution, and the partial answers which can be seen in
the conversation thread, we want to determine if we are on the good track to solve the task problem and score 
the proposed approaches in the range of [0.0, 10.0], the higher the score the more preferable.

Scoring criteria: 
* If the original task problem contains error and not solvable or we are at a dead-end or infinite loop trying to 
  solve the original, then all approaches except `UNSOLVABLE_I_GIVE_UP` get 0 scores.
* The approach must conform to the templates for Tao and parsable; else it should get a score of 0.
* Direct answers that are incorrect should get a score of 0.
* The approaches which lead to incorrect results should get a score of 0.
* The assumption implied/used should be correct.
* The questions asked by Tao should be relevant and non-redundant.
* The approach which looks more efficient and avoids unnecessary works is preferred.
* Try to avoid identical scores (except 0's;) you can use decimal points (e.g. 9.5) to 
  distinguish two different approaches. 
* But if two approaches are nearly identical except wordings or details of explanation, mark the later one as a 
  duplicate of the first; note: an approach can only duplicate another approach if the two are of same kinds, e.g. 
  two direct answers.

Response must be in valid JSON like this:

```json
{{
  "1": {{"score": 9.8, "reason": "your reasoning"}},
  "2": {{"score": 9.65, "duplicate_of": 1, "reason": "your explanation"}}
}}
```
