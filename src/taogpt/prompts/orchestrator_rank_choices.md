Tao has proposed the following different approaches:

{approaches}

---

Based on proposed problem solving approaches, the state of execution, and the partial answers which can be seen in
the conversation thread, we want to determine if we are on the good track to solve the task problem and score 
the proposed approaches in the range of [0.0, 10.0], the higher the score the more preferable.

Scoring criteria: 
* If the original task problem contains error and not solvable or we are at a dead-end or infinite loop trying to 
  solve the original, then all approaches except `BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR` get 0 scores.
* Direct answers that are incorrect should get a score of 0.
* The approaches which lead to incorrect results should get a score of 0.
* The assumption implied/used should be correct.
* The questions asked by Tao should be relevant and not trivial.
* For `HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN` approaches:
  * Worship Occam's razor. Prefer simpler, linear, decomposable steps without looping if possible. Loops are less 
    friendly to the top-down tree search problem solving method. Tao will backtrack by himself when things go wrong, 
    so no need to mention it in the step-by-step plan.
  * Think abstract. Prefer **elegant, generic, and high-level** plans. Avoid detailed, low-level, overly 
    specific steps. For example, prefer "Find and set missing elements to fill-in values" over "Set 2nd and 5th 
    elements to 22".
  * **Do NOT worry too much about the details in the plan**; Tao can work on the details later.
* Try to avoid identical scores (except 0's;) you can use decimal points (e.g. 9.5) to distinguish two different 
  approaches.
* Among similar approaches, mark others as duplicates of the best one; note: an approach can only duplicate another 
  approach if the two are of same kinds, e.g. two direct answers.

Response must be in valid JSON like this:

```json
{{
  "1": {{"score": 9.8, "reason": "your reasoning"}},
  "2": {{"score": 9.65, "duplicate_of": 1, "reason": "your explanation"}}
}}
