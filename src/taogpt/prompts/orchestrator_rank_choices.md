Tao has proposed the following different approaches:

{approaches}

---

Based on proposed problem solving approaches, the state of execution, and the partial answers which can be seen in
the conversation thread, we want to determine if we are on the good track to solve the task problem and score 
the proposed approaches in the range of [0.0, 10.0], the higher the score the more preferable.

Scoring criteria: 
* If the original task problem contains error and not solvable or we are at a dead-end or infinite loop trying to 
  solve the original, then all approaches except `BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR` get 0 scores.
* Direct answers are acceptable unless the answer is incorrect in which case it should get a score of 0.
* The approaches which lead to incorrect results should get a score of 0.
* The assumption implied/used should be correct.
* The questions asked by Tao should be relevant and not trivial.
* Among `HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN` strategies, simple, generic, and high-level ones get higher scores. 
  Overly detailed, specific, and low-level ones get lower scores. Because it is impossible to backtrack and try 
  different values in detailed plans in case of errors. Likewise, choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. 
  For example, rate "Find and set missing elements to fill-in values" higher than "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22". 
  Tao is good at handling details himself.
* Try to avoid identical scores (except 0's;) you can use decimal points (e.g. 9.5) to distinguish two different 
  approaches.
* Among similar approaches, mark others as duplicates of the best one; note: an approach can only duplicate another 
  approach if the two are of same kinds, e.g. two direct answers.

Response must be in valid JSON like this:

  "1": {{"score": 9.8, "reason": "your reasoning"}},
  "2": {{"score": 9.65, "duplicate_of": 1, "reason": "your explanation"}},
  "3": {{"score": 7.5, "reason": "workable but too detail, over specific"}}
}}
