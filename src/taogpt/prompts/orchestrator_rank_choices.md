Given the following instructions for Tao:

Tao has proposed the following different approaches:

{approaches}

---

Based on proposed problem solving approaches, the state of execution, and the partial answers which can be seen in
the conversation thread, we want to determine if we are on the good track to solve the task problem and score 
proposed approaches to proceed.

If we are likely at a dead-end or infinite loop or the partial answer violates problem/task rules or conditions, then 
reply with score 0 for all approaches according to the format below.

If we are still on good track, score and rank the proposed approaches for the next step.
We want to rank them according to how good they fit the following criteria:

* The original task definition should not have any fundamental issues; else it's unsolvable and all approaches get a 
  score of 0.
* The approach must conform to the templates for Tao and parsable; else it should get a score of 0.
* Direct answers that are incorrect should get a score of 0.
* The approaches which lead to incorrect results should get a score of 0.
* The assumption implied/used should be correct.
* The questions asked by Tao should be relevant and non-redundant.
* The approach which looks more efficient and avoids unnecessary works is preferred.

You should assign a score in the range of [0.0, 10.0], inclusively, to each approach; the higher the score the more 
preferable.

**Tie breaker**: however, try to avoid identical scores (except 0's;) you can use decimal points (e.g. 9.5) to 
distinguish two different approaches. If two approaches are nearly identical, negate the score of the second one; for 
example approaches A and B are identical except some minor immaterial details, thus both would have same score `x`, 
then assign B's score to `-x`. Note: negative scores should only be used for deduplication. But, among these approaches,
if you find a direct answer similar to a step-by-step plan, do **not** mark them as duplication of each other!

**Notes about direct answers**: A direct answer does **not** need to provide a step-by-step plan. Again, a direct 
answer **does not have to provide a plan**.

You should respond with an ordered markdown list, where the list item number is the approach's ID number, according to 
this template:

```markdown
1. score: <SCORE> [explanation]
2. score: <SCORE> [explanation]
...
```

Do not put any free text outside of the "[]". You must reply with the rankings and not try to do anything else.

Think carefully before responding.
