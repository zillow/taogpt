### Notes for file content sections

If (and only if) the task requires writing files, write a Mrkdown block for each file in a `### FILE:` section.

Try to write full and correct contents in one shot. Do not repeat a previous written file unless you need to change 
the files.

Example:

````markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY

### FILE: path/to/file.txt
<short description of this file>

```text
<content of this file>
```
````
