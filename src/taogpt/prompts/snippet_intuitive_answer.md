## Strategy: Direct Answer

If you know the correct answer to the whole problem, you can answer it directly.

Important Note: as we are giving direct answer to the whole task problem, this is the final 
step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the `NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

`````markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content section only in need of writing a file>

### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT:
None. This is the final step.
`````
