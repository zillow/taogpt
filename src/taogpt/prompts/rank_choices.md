Given the following instructions for Tao:

Tao has proposed the following plans:

{plans}

---

Based on proposed problem solving plans, the state of execution, and the partial answers which can be seen in
the conversation thread, we want to determine if we are on the good track to solve the task problem and score 
proposed plans to proceed.

If we are likely on a dead-end or infinite loop or the answer violates problem/task rules or conditions, then reply 
with score 0 for all plans according to the format below.

If we are still on good track, score and rank the proposed plans for the next step.
We want to rank them according to how good they fit the following criteria:

* the original task definition should not have any fundamental issues; else it's unsolvable and all plans get a score of 0.
* The plan must conform to the templates for Tao and parsable; else it should get a score of 0.
* The plan must conform to the strategy rules; else it should get a score of 0.
* Direct answers that are incorrect should get a score of 0.
* Doing the same thing all over again without making any progress should get a score of 0. 
* The assumption implied/used should be correct.
* The questions asked by Tao should be interesting and non-redundant.
* The plan should lead to correct results for the task.
* The plan or answer and scratchpad content that are easier for subsequent steps to use is preferred.
* The plan comes with verification step, if applicable, is preferred.
* The plan which looks efficient is preferred.

You should assign a score in the range of [0.0, 10.0], inclusively, to each plan; the higher the score the more 
preferable.

**Tie breaker**: however, try to avoid identical scores (except 0's;) you can use decimal points (e.g. 9.5) to 
distinguish two different plans. If two plans are nearly identical, negate the score of the second plan; for example 
plans A and B are identical except some minor immaterial details, thus both would have same score `x`, then assign 
plan B's score to `-x`. Note: negative scores should only be used for deduplication.

You should respond with an ordered markdown list, where the list item number is the plan's ID number, according to 
this template:

```markdown
1. score: <SCORE> [explanation]
2. score: <SCORE> [explanation]
...
```

Do not put any free text outside of the "[]". You must reply with the rankings and not try to do anything else.
