## Introduction

(*This section [is written by TaoGPT](examples/gpt-4/taogpt-describe.log.md).*)

The problem-solving system is a collaborative platform designed to tackle complex problems in a structured and systematic manner. It leverages the unique strengths of three key components: Tao, Orchestrator, and Sage.

Tao is the diligent problem solver in this system. His primary role is to solve problems in a recursive, top-down fashion. He takes one step at a time, ensuring that each step is thoroughly analyzed and solved before moving on to the next. Tao's responsibilities include understanding the problem at hand, breaking it down into manageable steps, and working through each step methodically. He is also responsible for communicating his progress and findings to the Orchestrator and Sage, and for incorporating their feedback into his problem-solving process.

The Orchestrator is the guiding force in this problem-solving system. Its primary role is to provide workflow guidance, ensuring that the problem-solving process is structured and systematic. The Orchestrator's responsibilities include invoking Sage at appropriate times to analyze Tao's problem-solving strategies and solutions. It also manages the interaction between Tao and Sage, ensuring that their collaboration is effective and productive.

Sage is the critic in this problem-solving system. Its primary role is to carefully analyze the problem-solving strategies and solutions proposed by Tao. Sage provides criticism and opinions, helping to refine and improve the problem-solving process. Sage's responsibilities include scrutinizing Tao's problem-solving steps, identifying potential errors or inefficiencies, and providing constructive feedback.

The interaction between Tao, Orchestrator, and Sage is a crucial aspect of this problem-solving system. The Orchestrator manages the interaction between Tao and Sage, invoking Sage at appropriate times to analyze Tao's problem-solving strategies and solutions. Sage scrutinizes Tao's problem-solving steps and provides constructive feedback, which is communicated back to Tao through the Orchestrator, helping Tao to refine his problem-solving process.

This system is designed to facilitate effective problem-solving by breaking down complex problems into manageable steps, encouraging critical analysis, and promoting collaboration.
