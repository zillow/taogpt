The given expression is `x mod (y - z)` where `x` is 10, `y` is 7, and `z` is 4.

Step 1: Calculate the value of the expression inside the parentheses `y - z`.

Substitute `y` = 7 and `z` = 4 into `y - z`.

I will use the calculator function to obtain the result.The result of `y - z` is 3.

So, the equation now becomes `x mod 3` where `x` is 10.

Step 2: Calculate the value for `x mod 3`.

"Mod" is the modulus operator, which gives the remainder of a division operation.

Therefore, we calculate the remainder when `x` = 10 is divided by 3. I'll use the calculator function for this as well.I'm sorry for the confusion. It seems like the calculator function does not support the mod operation.

However, the mod operation or modulus operation finds the remainder. In this case when 10 is divided by 3, it goes 3 times with a remainder of 1.

So, `10 mod 3` equals to `1`. Therefore, x mod (y - z) equals to `1` when x is 10, y is 7, and z is 4.
