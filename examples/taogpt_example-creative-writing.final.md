The problem statement is clear, concise, and does not seem to contain any fundamental errors or invalid assumptions. It asks for a coherent passage with four short paragraphs, each ending with a specific sentence. The challenge here will be to create a narrative or exposition that logically leads to these sentences. However, there are no invalid assumptions made in this problem statement.

1. Create a narrative or theme that can accommodate all four sentences. This will provide coherence to the passage.
2. Write the first paragraph, ending with "He found rain fascinating yet unpleasant." The paragraph should introduce the character and his peculiar relationship with rain.
3. Write the second paragraph, ending with "Abstraction is often one floor above you." This paragraph should delve deeper into the character's struggles, perhaps with understanding complex concepts or dealing with abstract ideas.
4. Write the third paragraph, ending with "Courage and stupidity were all he had." This paragraph can focus on the character's bravery and foolishness in facing his struggles.
5. Write the fourth paragraph, ending with "He had a wall full of masks so she could wear a different face every day." This paragraph should introduce another character, possibly the first character's romantic interest, and her habit of changing personas.

The narrative will be a coming of age tale, focusing on a young boy's journey of self-discovery and his relationship with a girl he meets along the way. The narrative will start in the boy's hometown, a coastal town often drenched in rain. The boy's love for the rain, yet his discomfort with it, will symbolize his complex feelings towards his hometown. The story will then progress to the boy moving to a big city for his studies, where he struggles with abstract concepts and ideas, symbolizing his struggle to fit in. Despite his struggles, the boy refuses to give up, showing his courage and, at times, his foolishness. The story will then introduce a girl, who, like the boy, has her own struggles. Her habit of wearing different faces symbolizes her struggle with identity and her fear of showing her true self to the world.

The story will revolve around these characters, their struggles, and how they overcome them. The ending sentences of each paragraph will serve as symbols or metaphors for the character's feelings or situations at that particular point in the narrative.

In the small coastal town where he was born, the rain was a frequent visitor. The boy enjoyed the rhythm of the raindrops on the rooftop and the way it washed everything clean. Yet, he also felt a sense of confinement, as the rain often kept him indoors, away from his adventures by the sea. He loved the smell of rain, the damp earthy fragrance that filled the air. However, the chill that it brought, seeping into his bones, was something he could never get used to. The rain was a paradox, much like his feelings for his hometown. He found rain fascinating yet unpleasant.

The city was a stark contrast to his quaint coastal town. Skyscrapers replaced the familiar lighthouse, the commotion of traffic drowned the calming sound of waves, and the complexities of city life replaced the simplicity he had grown accustomed to. His studies too, were a whirlwind of abstract concepts and theories, far removed from the tangible realities of his hometown. He often found himself staring at the ceiling, lost in thoughts, as he grappled with these abstract ideas. It was like trying to reach out to something that was always just beyond his grasp. Abstraction is often one floor above you.

Despite the challenges he faced, the boy refused to surrender. He spent nights battling with complex equations and abstract ideas, his determination fueled by humble beginnings and big dreams. Yet, his stubbornness often led him down difficult paths. There were times when he refused help, preferring to tackle problems on his own, even when the odds were stacked against him. His friends often called him courageous; others said he was simply foolish. But he knew the truth. Courage and stupidity were all he had.
