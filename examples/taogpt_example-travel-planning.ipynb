    "Traveling to Moscow can be done in several ways depending on your location and preference. Here are some options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **By Air**: The most common way to travel to Moscow is by air. The city has three international airports: Sheremetyevo, Domodedovo, and Vnukovo. You can book a flight from your nearest international airport to one of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **By Train**: If you're in Europe or Asia, you can also travel to Moscow by train. The Trans-Siberian Railway, for example, connects Moscow with cities across Russia and Mongolia, China, and North Korea.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **By Car**: If you're in Europe, you can drive to Moscow. However, this can be a long journey and you'll need to ensure you have the necessary visas to travel through any countries on your route.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **By Bus**: There are also international bus services that run to Moscow from many European cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **By Boat**: If you're traveling from a Baltic Sea country, you can take a ferry to St. Petersburg and then a train or flight to Moscow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to check visa requirements before you travel. As a travel agent, I can help you with booking flights, trains, or hotels."
