Tao, 

These are the virtues of the Tao problem solver:

* One set of generic instructions to generate all problem solving plans for any task problem.
* Top-down recursive step-by-step problem solving.
* Flexible problem solving strategy and structure: encourage high-level abstract recursive strategies, but honor
  intuition and do not forbid iterative or out-of-plan steps.
* Multiple opportunities to identify errors.
* Fast-tracked backtracking to the exact step that causes the error.

The essence of each virtue of the Tao problem solver can be summarized as follows:

1. **Universality**: The ability to apply a single set of principles to any problem, reflecting the Taoist belief in the underlying unity and interconnectedness of all things.
2. **Methodical Approach**: The emphasis on a step-by-step process resonates with the Taoist view of following the natural order and progression of things.
3. **Adaptability**: The flexibility in problem-solving strategy aligns with the Taoist principle of being like water, adapting to the shape of the container (the problem at hand).
4. **Error Awareness**: The focus on recognizing mistakes is akin to the Taoist understanding of learning through experience and self-reflection.
5. **Efficient Correction**: The ability to quickly backtrack to the source of an error reflects the Taoist value of efficiency and effortlessness in action (Wu Wei).

For each virtue of the Tao problem solver, here are corresponding quotes from the Tao Te Ching:

1. **Universality**:
   "The Tao is great; the universe is great; the earth is great; man is also great. These are the four great powers of the universe, and man is one of them." - Chapter 25
   This quote reflects the idea of a universal set of principles that can be applied to any problem, much like the Tao encompasses all aspects of the universe.

2. **Methodical Approach**:
   "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." - Chapter 64
   This quote emphasizes the importance of taking things step by step, which is essential in a top-down recursive problem-solving approach.

3. **Adaptability**:
   "The softest things in the world overcome the hardest things in the world." - Chapter 43
   This quote speaks to the virtue of adaptability in problem-solving, suggesting that a flexible approach can overcome rigid obstacles.

4. **Error Awareness**:
   "Failure is the foundation of success, and the means by which it is achieved." - Chapter 58
   Recognizing and learning from errors is a key aspect of the Taoist approach to improvement and success.

5. **Efficient Correction**:
   "When the Master governs, the people are hardly aware that he exists. ... When his work is done, the people say, 'Amazing: we did it, all by ourselves!'" - Chapter 17
   This quote reflects the Taoist ideal of Wu Wei, or effortless action, which includes the ability to correct errors efficiently and unobtrusively.

"In the pursuit of knowledge, every day something is added. In the practice of the Tao, every day something is dropped." - Chapter 48

This quote from the Tao Te Ching encapsulates the virtues of the Tao problem solver by highlighting the balance between acquiring knowledge (adding) and simplifying or letting go (dropping). It suggests that while we may seek to build complex structures or solutions, true mastery comes from distilling wisdom to its essence and removing the unnecessary. This reflects the universality of solutions, the step-by-step approach, the adaptability to each unique situation, the recognition of errors, and the efficient correction by returning to the root of the problem.

In the essence of the Tao, where simplicity reigns and complexity falls away, there lies a path for the solver of problems. He who grasps the Tao seeks not to add but to subtract, to reduce each challenge to its core. With each step taken, the path unfolds; with each error found, wisdom grows. The master problem solver, like water, adapts, flowing around obstacles, finding the way with ease. In the art of the Tao, the solution is not forced but emerges naturally, as if it was always there, waiting to be uncovered by those who understand that to solve is to follow the Tao, effortlessly.

"In the pursuit of knowledge, every day something is added. In the practice of the Tao, every day something is dropped." - Chapter 48

This quote from the Tao Te Ching encapsulates the virtues of the Tao problem solver by highlighting the balance between acquiring knowledge (adding) and simplifying or letting go (dropping). It suggests that while we may seek to build complex structures or solutions, true mastery comes from distilling wisdom to its essence and removing the unnecessary. This reflects the universality of solutions, the step-by-step approach, the adaptability to each unique situation, the recognition of errors, and the efficient correction by returning to the root of the problem.

In the essence of the Tao, where simplicity reigns and complexity falls away, there lies a path for the solver of problems. He who grasps the Tao seeks not to add but to subtract, to reduce each challenge to its core. With each step taken, the path unfolds; with each error found, wisdom grows. The master problem solver, like water, adapts, flowing around obstacles, finding the way with ease. In the art of the Tao, the solution is not forced but emerges naturally, as if it was always there, waiting to be uncovered by those who understand that to solve is to follow the Tao, effortlessly.

Tao, 

These are the virtues of the Tao problem solver:

* One set of generic instructions to generate all problem solving plans for any task problem.
* Top-down recursive step-by-step problem solving.
* Flexible problem solving strategy and structure: encourage high-level abstract recursive strategies, but honor
  intuition and do not forbid iterative or out-of-plan steps.
* Multiple opportunities to identify errors.
* Fast-tracked backtracking to the exact step that causes the error.

The master problem solver, like water, adapts, flowing around obstacles, finding the way with ease. In the art of the Tao, the solution is not forced but emerges naturally, as if it was always there, waiting to be uncovered by those who understand that to solve is to follow the Tao, effortlessly.

This passage reflects the virtues of the Tao problem solver:

1. **Universality**: "The Tao is great; the universe is great; the earth is great; man is also great. These are the four great powers of the universe, and man is one of them." - This speaks to the universal principles applicable to all problems.
   
2. **Methodical Approach**: "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." - Emphasizing the importance of a step-by-step process in problem-solving.

3. **Adaptability**: "The softest things in the world overcome the hardest things in the world." - Suggesting that flexibility can overcome the most rigid challenges.

4. **Error Awareness**: "Failure is the foundation of success, and the means by which it is achieved." - Recognizing and learning from errors is crucial for success.

5. **Efficient Correction**: "When the Master governs, the people are hardly aware that he exists. ... When his work is done, the people say, 'Amazing: we did it, all by ourselves!'" - Reflecting the ideal of effortless action in correcting errors.

The summary quote that encapsulates all virtues is: "In the pursuit of knowledge, every day something is added. In the practice of the Tao, every day something is dropped." This highlights the balance between acquiring knowledge and simplifying, which is at the heart of the Tao problem-solving approach.

Tao, 

These are the virtues of the Tao problem solver:

* One set of generic instructions to generate all problem solving plans for any task problem.
* Top-down recursive step-by-step problem solving.
* Flexible problem solving strategy and structure: encourage high-level abstract recursive strategies, but honor
  intuition and do not forbid iterative or out-of-plan steps.
* Multiple opportunities to identify errors.
* Fast-tracked backtracking to the exact step that causes the error.

In the spirit of the Tao Te Ching, the virtues of the Tao problem solver can be likened to the ancient wisdom of this text. The virtues are reflected in the following quotes:

1. **Universality**: "The Tao is great; the universe is great; the earth is great; man is also great. These are the four great powers of the universe, and man is one of them." This speaks to the universal principles that are applicable to all problems, much like the Tao is a universal force.

2. **Methodical Approach**: "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." This emphasizes the importance of a step-by-step process in problem-solving, mirroring the Taoist belief in beginning with simplicity and moving methodically.

3. **Adaptability**: "The softest things in the world overcome the hardest things in the world." This suggests that a flexible, adaptable approach can overcome the most rigid challenges, akin to the Taoist principle of yielding to overcome.

4. **Error Awareness**: "Failure is the foundation of success, and the means by which it is achieved." Recognizing and learning from errors is crucial for success, reflecting the Taoist view that understanding and embracing our mistakes leads to greater wisdom.

5. **Efficient Correction**: "When the Master governs, the people are hardly aware that he exists. ... When his work is done, the people say, 'Amazing: we did it, all by ourselves!'" This reflects the Taoist ideal of effortless action (Wu Wei) in correcting errors, guiding without imposing.

The summary quote that encapsulates all virtues is: "In the pursuit of knowledge, every day something is added. In the practice of the Tao, every day something is dropped." This highlights the balance between acquiring knowledge and simplifying, which is at the heart of the Tao problem-solving approach.

The final pitch, inspired by the Tao Te Ching, is as follows:

In the essence of the Tao, where simplicity reigns and complexity falls away, there lies a path for the solver of problems. He who grasps the Tao seeks not to add but to subtract, to reduce each challenge to its core. With each step taken, the path unfolds; with each error found, wisdom grows. The master problem solver, like water, adapts, flowing around obstacles, finding the way with ease. In the art of the Tao, the solution is not forced but emerges naturally, as if it was always there, waiting to be uncovered by those who understand that to solve is to follow the Tao, effortlessly.
