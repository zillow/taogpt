Given your preference for a quiet environment and the need for a good middle school for your children, as well as your budget of $2500 for rent, here are some potential neighborhoods or cities within a reasonable commuting distance to First St. in San Jose:

1. **Santa Clara**: It's close to San Jose, has a suburban feel, and offers a variety of good schools. The commute to downtown San Jose is typically manageable.

2. **Sunnyvale**: This city is known for its family-friendly neighborhoods and good schools. It's also tech-friendly and has a relatively short commute to San Jose.

3. **Milpitas**: Located north of San Jose, Milpitas offers a suburban environment with access to good schools. It's also close to the tech hubs, which might be beneficial if you're working in that sector.

4. **Campbell**: A bit further out but still within a reasonable commute to San Jose, Campbell has a small-town feel with good schools and a family-friendly atmosphere.

5. **Cupertino**: Known for its excellent schools, Cupertino is a desirable location for families. However, rents can be high, so finding something within your budget might be more challenging.

6. **Los Gatos**: This area is more upscale and quiet, with excellent schools, but the rent might be on the higher end.

7. **Willow Glen**: A neighborhood in San Jose known for its charm and community feel, with good schools and a quieter environment compared to downtown.

8. **Almaden Valley**: Located within San Jose, this area is known for its quiet neighborhoods and excellent schools, but it might be a stretch for your budget.

When considering these options, you'll want to balance the commute time, the quality of the schools, and the rental prices to find the best fit for your family. It's also worth noting that traffic can be heavy in the Bay Area, so living closer to your workplace in San Jose could significantly reduce your daily commute time.

Based on my knowledge as of early 2023, the average rent prices in the identified areas around San Jose for a family-sized accommodation can vary widely. Here's a rough estimate:

1. **Santa Clara**: The average rent for a 2-bedroom apartment could be around $2,500 to $3,000, which is at the top end of your budget.

2. **Sunnyvale**: Rent prices here are similar to Santa Clara, with 2-bedroom apartments typically ranging from $2,400 to $3,000.

3. **Milpitas**: You might find 2-bedroom apartments ranging from $2,300 to $2,800, which could fit your budget.

4. **Campbell**: Rent for a 2-bedroom might be slightly lower than in Santa Clara or Sunnyvale, possibly between $2,300 and $2,900.

5. **Cupertino**: This area is known for higher rents due to the quality of schools, with 2-bedroom apartments often exceeding $3,000.

6. **Los Gatos**: This upscale area typically has higher rents, and a 2-bedroom could easily exceed $3,000.

7. **Willow Glen**: Rent for a 2-bedroom apartment could range from $2,400 to $3,000, depending on the exact location and amenities.

8. **Almaden Valley**: This area is also on the higher end, with 2-bedroom apartments likely starting at around $2,800 and going up.

Given your budget of $2,500, Milpitas, Campbell, and certain parts of Sunnyvale or Willow Glen might offer the best options for staying within your budget while also providing a quiet environment and access to good middle schools. However, prices can fluctuate, and deals can be found, so it's always best to check current listings and perhaps consider a rental agent to help find the best value within your budget.

To investigate the quality of middle schools in each area, you would typically look at a variety of factors including academic performance, teacher-to-student ratios, extracurricular offerings, and overall school environment. Reviews from parents and educational rating websites can provide valuable insights into the quality of schools.

For the areas mentioned:

1. **Santa Clara**: Schools in Santa Clara are generally well-regarded, with several having high ratings for academic performance.

2. **Sunnyvale**: Sunnyvale also boasts a number of quality schools, with a focus on STEM education due to its proximity to Silicon Valley.

3. **Milpitas**: Milpitas has a diverse school district with some schools performing very well academically.

4. **Campbell**: The Campbell Union School District serves this area and includes some schools that are highly rated, particularly for their strong community involvement.

5. **Cupertino**: Known for having some of the best schools in the state, Cupertino's schools often have high academic performance scores.

6. **Los Gatos**: Schools in Los Gatos are typically very well-rated, with strong academic programs and a variety of extracurricular activities.

7. **Willow Glen**: The schools in Willow Glen, which are part of the San Jose Unified School District, offer a solid education with several having good reputations.

8. **Almaden Valley**: This area is known for having excellent schools, with high academic standards and a strong sense of community.

Given your budget and requirements, Milpitas, Campbell, and parts of Sunnyvale or Willow Glen might be the best areas to focus on for a combination of affordability and quality middle schools. Cupertino and Los Gatos tend to have excellent schools but might be less affordable. Santa Clara and Almaden Valley also have good schools but may be on the higher end of your budget. It's important to visit the schools personally and talk to local parents if possible to get the most accurate information.

To check for the availability of rental properties that meet your budget and size requirements in the areas with good schools, you would typically conduct the following actions:

1. **Search Online Real Estate Listings**: Websites like XXXXXX, XXXXXX, and XXXXXX are commonly used to find rental properties. You would filter your search by the cities or neighborhoods you're interested in, your budget, and the number of bedrooms you need.

2. **Contact Local Real Estate Agents**: Real estate agents can be very helpful in finding rental properties that are not listed online. They can also provide insights into the local housing market and school districts.

3. **Check Local Classifieds**: Sometimes landlords list their properties in local newspapers or online classified websites like Craigslist.

4. **Drive Around Neighborhoods**: Driving around the neighborhoods you're interested in can sometimes yield "For Rent" signs not listed online.

5. **Use Social Media and Community Groups**: Local community groups on social media platforms or apps like Nextdoor can be a good resource for rental listings and community feedback on schools and neighborhoods.

6. **Contact School Districts**: Some school districts have resources for new families moving into the area, including information on housing.

Given your budget of $2,500 per month for rent, you would look for properties within this price range that are located in areas served by good middle schools. Since you're moving with your family, you would likely need at least a 2-bedroom property. You would prioritize areas like Milpitas, Campbell, and parts of Sunnyvale or Willow Glen based on the balance of affordability, school quality, and a quiet environment.

To evaluate the overall environment of the final candidates for neighborhoods or cities to ensure a quiet, family-friendly atmosphere, you would consider the following aspects:

- **Crime Rates**: Lower crime rates are typically indicative of a safer, more family-friendly environment. You can usually find this information through local police department reports or online crime mapping services.

- **Parks and Recreation**: Look for neighborhoods with access to parks, playgrounds, and recreational facilities, which are great for children and contribute to a family-friendly atmosphere.

- **Community Events**: Areas that host family-oriented community events, such as farmers' markets, festivals, and holiday celebrations, often have a strong sense of community and are more likely to be family-friendly.

- **Traffic and Noise Levels**: Quieter neighborhoods with less traffic are generally more desirable for families. This can often be assessed by visiting the area at different times of the day.

- **Local Amenities**: Proximity to libraries, community centers, and family-friendly restaurants can also be indicators of a family-oriented neighborhood.

- **Neighborhood Demographics**: Areas with a higher percentage of families with children might offer a more supportive environment for your kids to make friends and for you to connect with other parents.

Based on these criteria, areas like Milpitas, Campbell, and parts of Sunnyvale or Willow Glen could be good options. These areas are known to offer a balance of quiet residential living with access to parks and good schools, which are conducive to a family-friendly atmosphere.
