[at step#0: task statement]

We need to document Tao the problem solver.

Tao and Sage are implemented by large language models. They can be different models or one single model acting in different roles. The Orchestrator is a mechanical program.

You can see Tao's role and responsibility in the system prompt and "Problem Solving Instructions". Tao can also 
invoke Python Genie, a Python runtime environment, to help out. These are the virtues of the Tao problem solver:

* One set of generic instructions for any task problem, implying generality.
* At every step, make judgement to choose among answering the step with intuition, decompose into further sub-steps, ask for help, or seek clarification.
* Thus enabling flexible problem solving strategy and structure: encourage high-level abstract recursive strategies, but honor intuition and yet do not forbid iterative or out-of-plan steps.
* The characteristics above make Tao work hard and diligently to provide comprehensive solutions rather than generic fuzzy answers often dossed out by LLMs.
* These are achieved without task-specific direction or human nudging.

Note that while Orchestrator provides workflow guidance, it invokes Sage, a serious critic, to carefully analyzes 
problem solving strategies and solutions and give out criticism and opinions for the problem solver. Orchestrator 
will then guide Tao to fix any issues found by Sage. If multiple attempts fail to remedy errors, Orchestrator will 
guide Tao to backtrack to the culprit step and restart from there.

Write up no more than 3 paragraphs about Tao, Orchestrator, Sage and this problem solving system. Pay special 
attention to the characteristic and advantage of the system.

To ensure a comprehensive understanding and accurate documentation of the problem-solving system involving Tao, Orchestrator, and Sage, I need to clarify the following:

1. What specific roles and responsibilities does Sage have in analyzing the problem-solving strategies and solutions provided by Tao?
2. Can you provide examples of the types of errors or issues that Sage typically identifies in Tao's solutions?
3. How does the Orchestrator facilitate the interaction between Tao and Sage, especially in scenarios where multiple attempts fail to remedy errors identified by Sage?

***MY_THOUGHT***



In the innovative problem-solving system, Tao serves as the primary problem solver, diligently working through tasks using a recursive, top-down approach. Tao's role is to methodically address each problem step by step, deciding at every juncture whether to answer intuitively, decompose the problem further, seek help, or ask for clarification. This flexible strategy allows Tao to adapt to various challenges without needing task-specific instructions or external guidance.

The Orchestrator acts as the workflow manager in this system, coordinating the interactions between Tao and Sage. It ensures that Tao adheres to the problem-solving process and invokes Sage when necessary. Sage functions as a critical analyst, meticulously reviewing Tao's strategies and solutions to identify any potential errors or areas for improvement. If errors are detected, the Orchestrator guides Tao in correcting these issues or, if multiple attempts fail, advises backtracking to the problematic step for a fresh approach.

This system's primary advantage lies in its structured yet adaptable framework, which promotes thorough and precise problem-solving while allowing for flexibility in approach. The recursive method encourages deep understanding and comprehensive solutions, significantly reducing the likelihood of superficial or incomplete responses. Moreover, the inclusion of a critical review process through Sage ensures high-quality outputs, as it continuously refines and improves the solutions provided by Tao.

We need to document Tao the problem solver.

Tao and Sage are implemented by large language models. They can be different models or one single model acting in different roles. The Orchestrator is a mechanical program.

You can see Tao's role and responsibility in the system prompt and "Problem Solving Instructions". Tao can also 
invoke Python Genie, a Python runtime environment, to help out. These are the virtues of the Tao problem solver:

* One set of generic instructions for any task problem, implying generality.
* At every step, make judgement to choose among answering the step with intuition, decompose into further sub-steps, ask for help, or seek clarification.
* Thus enabling flexible problem solving strategy and structure: encourage high-level abstract recursive strategies, but honor intuition and yet do not forbid iterative or out-of-plan steps.
* The characteristics above make Tao work hard and diligently to provide comprehensive solutions rather than generic fuzzy answers often dossed out by LLMs.
* These are achieved without task-specific direction or human nudging.

Note that while Orchestrator provides workflow guidance, it invokes Sage, a serious critic, to carefully analyzes 
problem solving strategies and solutions and give out criticism and opinions for the problem solver. Orchestrator 
will then guide Tao to fix any issues found by Sage. If multiple attempts fail to remedy errors, Orchestrator will 
guide Tao to backtrack to the culprit step and restart from there.

[at step#13: Summarize the overall advantages and characteristics of the system, highlighting flexibility, error management, and recursive problem-solving approach]

The problem-solving system comprising Tao, Orchestrator, and Sage offers a robust framework for addressing complex tasks with precision and adaptability. One of the standout features of this system is its flexibility, enabled by Tao's ability to choose from multiple problem-solving strategies—whether intuitive responses, decomposition into sub-steps, seeking help, or requesting clarifications. This flexibility ensures that solutions are not only tailored to the specific requirements of each task but also optimized for thoroughness and accuracy.

Error management is another critical advantage. The system incorporates a dynamic error-checking and correction mechanism, where Sage plays a key role in identifying and suggesting improvements for any potential flaws in Tao's solutions. The Orchestrator facilitates this process by guiding Tao to correct these errors or, when necessary, to backtrack to the root of the problem and rework the solution from there. This iterative process not only enhances the quality of the output but also contributes to the continuous improvement of Tao's problem-solving skills.

Lastly, the recursive problem-solving approach adopted by Tao encourages a deep and systematic exploration of problems. This method allows for building solutions incrementally, ensuring that each component of the solution is sound before proceeding to the next. Such a structured approach reduces the risk of overlooking critical details and promotes the development of comprehensive solutions that are both effective and reliable. Together, these characteristics define a system that is not only capable of high-quality problem-solving but also equipped to refine and perfect its methods continuously.

Tao's role is to methodically address each problem step by step, deciding at every juncture whether to answer intuitively, decompose the problem further, seek help, or ask for clarification. This flexible strategy allows Tao to adapt to various challenges without needing task-specific instructions or external guidance.

The Orchestrator acts as the workflow manager in this system, coordinating the interactions between Tao and Sage. It ensures that Tao adheres to the problem-solving process and invokes Sage when necessary. Sage functions as a critical analyst, meticulously reviewing Tao's strategies and solutions to identify any potential errors or areas for improvement. If errors are detected, the Orchestrator guides Tao in correcting these issues or, if multiple attempts fail, advises backtracking to the problematic step for a fresh approach.

This system's primary advantage lies in its structured yet adaptable framework, which promotes thorough and precise problem-solving while allowing for flexibility in approach. The recursive method encourages deep understanding and comprehensive solutions, significantly reducing the likelihood of superficial or incomplete responses. Moreover, the inclusion of a critical review process through Sage ensures high-quality outputs, as it continuously refines and improves the solutions provided by Tao.

[at step#10: Elaborate on the role of Sage as a critic, the types of errors Sage identifies, and how failures are managed through backtracking]

Sage plays a crucial role in the problem-solving system as the critic, ensuring that the solutions provided by Tao are not only effective but also robust and error-free. Sage meticulously analyzes Tao's problem-solving strategies and solutions, focusing on logical consistency, completeness, and adherence to the problem requirements. The types of errors Sage is equipped to identify include logical fallacies, incomplete solutions, and deviations from the task's specifications.

When errors are detected by Sage, the system does not simply halt or discard the work done so far. Instead, it employs a strategic backtracking mechanism managed by the Orchestrator. This process involves revisiting the steps where errors were introduced and reworking the solution from that point. This method ensures that the integrity of the solution is maintained while minimizing the need to redo work that is not directly affected by the errors. This approach not only corrects errors but also serves as a learning opportunity for Tao, enhancing its problem-solving capabilities over time. The ability to backtrack and correct course also adds a layer of reliability and trustworthiness to the system, ensuring high-quality, error-free solutions.

[at step#13: Summarize the overall advantages and characteristics of the system, highlighting flexibility, error management, and recursive problem-solving approach]

The problem-solving system comprising Tao, Orchestrator, and Sage offers a robust framework for addressing complex tasks with precision and adaptability. One of the standout features of this system is its flexibility, enabled by Tao's ability to choose from multiple problem-solving strategies—whether intuitive responses, decomposition into sub-steps, seeking help, or requesting clarifications. This flexibility ensures that solutions are not only tailored to the specific requirements of each task but also optimized for thoroughness and accuracy.

Error management is another critical advantage. The system incorporates a dynamic error-checking and correction mechanism, where Sage plays a key role in identifying and suggesting improvements for any potential flaws in Tao's solutions. The Orchestrator facilitates this process by guiding Tao to correct these errors or, when necessary, to backtrack to the root of the problem and rework the solution from there. This iterative process not only enhances the quality of the output but also contributes to the continuous improvement of Tao's problem-solving skills.

Lastly, the recursive problem-solving approach adopted by Tao encourages a deep and systematic exploration of problems. This method allows for building solutions incrementally, ensuring that each component of the solution is sound before proceeding to the next. Such a structured approach reduces the risk of overlooking critical details and promotes the development of comprehensive solutions that are both effective and reliable. Together, these characteristics define a system that is not only capable of high-quality problem-solving but also equipped to refine and perfect its methods continuously.

We need to document Tao the problem solver.

Tao and Sage are implemented by large language models. They can be different models or one single model acting in different roles. The Orchestrator is a mechanical program.

You can see Tao's role and responsibility in the system prompt and "Problem Solving Instructions". Tao can also 
invoke Python Genie, a Python runtime environment, to help out. These are the virtues of the Tao problem solver:

* One set of generic instructions for any task problem, implying generality.
* At every step, make judgement to choose among answering the step with intuition, decompose into further sub-steps, ask for help, or seek clarification.
* Thus enabling flexible problem solving strategy and structure: encourage high-level abstract recursive strategies, but honor intuition and yet do not forbid iterative or out-of-plan steps.
* The characteristics above make Tao work hard and diligently to provide comprehensive solutions rather than generic fuzzy answers often dossed out by LLMs.
* These are achieved without task-specific direction or human nudging.

Note that while Orchestrator provides workflow guidance, it invokes Sage, a serious critic, to carefully analyzes 
problem solving strategies and solutions and give out criticism and opinions for the problem solver. Orchestrator 
will then guide Tao to fix any issues found by Sage. If multiple attempts fail to remedy errors, Orchestrator will 
guide Tao to backtrack to the culprit step and restart from there.

Write up no more than 3 paragraphs about Tao, Orchestrator, Sage and this problem solving system. Pay special 
attention to the characteristic and advantage of the system.
