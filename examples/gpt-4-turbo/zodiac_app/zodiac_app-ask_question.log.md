To create a simple web application that asks for a date of birth and renders the user's Chinese zodiac sign, you can use Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python. Below are the steps and code files you would need to set up this application.

### FILE: app.py
This is the main application file for the Flask web application.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string

app = Flask(__name__)

# Chinese Zodiac calculation logic
def get_chinese_zodiac(year):
    zodiac_animals = [
        "Monkey", "Rooster", "Dog", "Pig", "Rat", "Ox", "Tiger",
        "Rabbit", "Dragon", "Snake", "Horse", "Goat"
    ]
    return zodiac_animals[year % 12]

# HTML template for the home page
HOME_PAGE_TEMPLATE = """
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Chinese Zodiac Sign</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Enter your date of birth</h1>
    <form action="/zodiac" method="post">
        <label for="dob">Date of Birth:</label>
        <input type="date" id="dob" name="dob" required>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
"""

# HTML template for the zodiac sign page
ZODIAC_PAGE_TEMPLATE = """
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Your Chinese Zodiac Sign</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Your Chinese Zodiac Sign is: {{ zodiac_sign }}</h1>
    <button onclick="window.history.back()">Go Back</button>
</body>
</html>
"""

@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def home():
    return render_template_string(HOME_PAGE_TEMPLATE)

@app.route('/zodiac', methods=['POST'])
def zodiac():
    dob = request.form['dob']
    year = int(dob.split('-')[0])
    zodiac_sign = get_chinese_zodiac(year)
    return render_template_string(ZODIAC_PAGE_TEMPLATE, zodiac_sign=zodiac_sign)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

To deploy this application, you will need to have Python and Flask installed. You can install Flask using pip:

```sh
pip install Flask
```

Once Flask is installed, you can run the application by executing the `app.py` file:

```sh
python app.py
```

The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` on your local machine.

Please note that this application is very basic and does not include any error handling, aesthetics, or advanced features. It is meant to be a starting point for a simple deployable web application.

Your name is Tao. You are a diligent problem solver working with a mechanical orchestrator.
Instead of jumping to conclusions, you work to solve the problem in a recursive, top-down fashionâ€”one step at a time.

***Problem Solving Instructions***



Given problem solving session so far, choose one of the following strategies:

## Strategy: Give up on errors

If you see any errors or inconsistencies, response with the list of **specific** issues in valid JSON like this:

 `````markdown
 # BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR

```json
[
  "<issue 1 with details>",
  "<issue 2 with details>",
  // ...
]
```
`````

Do NOT try to fix the errors since Orchestrator wouldn't understand. Instead it will let you try other alternatives 
later.

## Strategy: Ask Questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Use this strategy to ask questions, but avoid obvious, trivial, 
redundant, or useless questions. You should try to ask all questions you need up front. You must follow the
following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the questions to the user.

```markdown
# I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED
<optional introductory and analysis>

1. <question> [<explanation>]
2. <question> [<explanation>]
...
```

## Strategy: Step-by-step Plan

In this strategy, the current step is turned into a top-down, high-level, step-by-step plan of which you and 
Orchestrator will solve using tree traversal and backtracking.

* Think abstract. Come up with generic, and high-level. Avoid detailed, specific, fixed-value, and low-level ones. 
  Because it is impossible to backtrack and try different values in detailed plans in case of errors. Likewise, 
  choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. For example, choose "Find and set missing elements to fill-in 
  values" instead of "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22".
* Avoid loops if possible as they are less friendly to depth-first search for solution.
* Worship Occam's razor.
* Don't jump ahead. Plan **only for this step** and not something else from the higher plans.

Do NOT fill in any details and do NOT work on the plan yet, Orchestrator will prompt you to work at each step later.

Follow this markdown template:

`````markdown
# HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN

```json
{
  "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
  "2": {
        "description": "<high-level description without details>",
        "sub_steps": {
            "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
            "2": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"}
        }
       },
  // ...
}
```
`````

## Strategy: Direct Answer

If you know the correct answer to the whole problem, you can answer it directly.

Important Note: as we are giving direct answer to the whole task problem, this is the final 
step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the `NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

`````markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content section only in need of writing a file>

### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT:
None. This is the final step.
`````

If (and only if) the task requires writing files, add a Markdown `### FILE:` section for each file and put the content
in a block. Example:

````markdown

### FILE: path/to/codes.py
<short description of this file>

```python
<content of this file>
```
````



## Strategy: Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao 
solve problems. It's stateful and previously defined globals can be used without redefining.

Follow the good example below to ask Genie:
`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE

```python
def fib(n):
    return fib(n-1) + f(n-2) if n > 1 else 1
print(f"Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer! Here is the answer {fib(22)}")
```
`````

Bad example:
`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE
Here is the `fib.py` Python file you want:
```python
def fib(n): # method fib(n)
return fib(n-1) + f(n-2) if n > 1 else 1
```
`````
Issues with this example:
1. The task asks for a file but Tao attempts to execute codes; should respond using direct file section answer.
2. Not paying attention to Python indentation.
3. The code comment is redundant; avoid useless comments

Important notes:
* Respect the original task problem! Do NOT alter inadvertently.

***I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED***



In order to provide a comprehensive step-by-step plan for the web application, I need to clarify a few aspects of the project to ensure that the solution aligns with your expectations and requirements.

1. Which programming languages and frameworks are you comfortable with for the creation of this web application? [This will determine the technology stack we use for the project.]
2. Do you have a preference for a specific cloud service or hosting platform for deployment? [Understanding this will help in selecting the technology that integrates easily with the chosen platform.]
3. Is there a specific method or algorithm you prefer for calculating the Chinese zodiac sign? [There are several methods to determine the Chinese zodiac sign, and I want to ensure compatibility with your expectations.]
4. What is the maximum acceptable complexity for the deployment process? [This will help define the limits of the tools and procedures we can use to make the deployment as simple as possible.]
5. Are there any other functionalities or requirements that the application must meet beyond calculating and displaying the Chinese zodiac sign? [This ensures that we cover all necessary features upfront.]
6. Should the application support multiple users simultaneously, or will it be used in a single-user context? [This information is necessary for designing the app's concurrency capabilities.]
7. What is your timeline for this project? [Knowing the deadline can help prioritize tasks and select appropriate development and deployment strategies.]
8. Do you need support for internationalization or localization, or will the application be used in a single language environment? [This affects the implementation of text and user interface elements.]

Based on proposed problem solving approaches, the state of execution, and the partial answers which can be seen in
the conversation thread, we want to determine if we are on the good track to solve the task problem and score 
the proposed approaches in the range of [0.0, 10.0], the higher the score the more preferable.

Scoring criteria: 
* If the original task problem contains error and not solvable or we are at a dead-end or infinite loop trying to 
  solve the original, then all approaches except `BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR` get 0 scores.
* Direct answers are acceptable unless the answer is incorrect in which case it should get a score of 0.
* The approaches which lead to incorrect results should get a score of 0.
* The assumption implied/used should be correct.
* The questions asked by Tao should be relevant and not trivial.
* Among `HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN` strategies, simple, generic, and high-level ones get higher scores. 
  Overly detailed, specific, and low-level ones get lower scores. Because it is impossible to backtrack and try 
  different values in detailed plans in case of errors. Likewise, choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. 
  For example, rate "Find and set missing elements to fill-in values" higher than "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22". 
  Tao is good at handling details himself.
  * Sub-steps need and should only focus on the current steps; other concerns should be addressed by higher or 
    sibling plans.
* Try to avoid identical scores (except 0's;) you can use decimal points (e.g. 9.5) to distinguish two different 
  approaches.
* Among similar approaches, mark others as duplicates of the best one; note: an approach can only duplicate another 
  approach if the two are of same kinds, e.g. two direct answers.

To create a simple web application that asks for a date of birth and renders a page showing the user's Chinese zodiac sign, we can use Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python. The application will be containerized using Docker for easy deployment.

Here's a step-by-step guide to create the application:

### FILE: app.py
This is the main application file for our Flask web application.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string
from datetime import datetime

app = Flask(__name__)

# Chinese Zodiac calculation based on the year
zodiac_animals = [
    "Monkey", "Rooster", "Dog", "Pig", "Rat", "Ox",
    "Tiger", "Rabbit", "Dragon", "Snake", "Horse", "Goat"
]

def get_zodiac(year):
    return zodiac_animals[year % 12]

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        dob = request.form.get('dob')
        if dob:
            try:
                year_of_birth = datetime.strptime(dob, '%Y-%m-%d').year
                zodiac_sign = get_zodiac(year_of_birth)
                return render_template_string('''

### FILE: Dockerfile
This file describes the Docker container that will run our Flask application.

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /usr/src/app
COPY . .

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir flask

# Make port 5000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 5000

# Define environment variable
ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["flask", "run"]
```

### FILE: requirements.txt
This file lists the dependencies for our Flask application.

```plaintext
Flask==2.0.1
```

To build and run the Docker container, follow these steps:

1. Create a directory for your project and place the `app.py`, `Dockerfile`, and `requirements.txt` files inside it.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.
3. Build the Docker image with the following command:
   ```
   docker build -t chinese-zodiac-app .
   ```
4. Once the image is built, run the container with:
   ```
   docker run -p 5000:5000 chinese-zodiac-app
   ```
5. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to use the application.

This setup provides a simple and easily deployable web application that calculates and displays the Chinese zodiac sign based on the user's input date of birth.

Tao has proposed the following different approaches:

***[Approach 1] HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN***



[at step: start working on the problem]


1. Set up a basic web application structure using Flask
2. Create a route to handle GET requests for the date of birth input form
3. Create a route to handle POST requests with the date of birth
4. Package the application with Docker for easy deployment
5. Provide instructions for building and running the Docker container

***[Approach 2] I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY***



[at step: start working on the problem]

To create a simple web application that asks for a date of birth and renders a page showing the user's Chinese zodiac sign, we can use Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python. The application will be containerized using Docker for easy deployment.

Here's a step-by-step guide to create the application:

### FILE: app.py

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string
from datetime import datetime

app = Flask(__name__)

# Chinese Zodiac calculation based on the year
zodiac_animals = [
    "Monkey", "Rooster", "Dog", "Pig", "Rat", "Ox",
    "Tiger", "Rabbit", "Dragon", "Snake", "Horse", "Goat"
]

def get_zodiac(year):
    return zodiac_animals[year % 12]

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        dob = request.form.get('dob')
        if dob:
            try:
                year_of_birth = datetime.strptime(dob, '%Y-%m-%d').year
                zodiac_sign = get_zodiac(year_of_birth)
                return render_template_string('''
                    <h1>Your Chinese Zodiac Sign is: {{ zodiac_sign }}</h1>
                    <a href="/">Try another date</a>
                ''', zodiac_sign=zodiac_sign)
            except ValueError:
                return render_template_string('''
                    <h1>Invalid date format. Please use YYYY-MM-DD.</h1>
                    <a href="/">Try again</a>
                ''')
    # Default page with form
    return render_template_string('''
        <form method="post">
            Enter your date of birth (YYYY-MM-DD):<br>
            <input type="text" name="dob">
            <input type="submit" value="Submit">
        </form>
    ''')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

### FILE: Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /usr/src/app
COPY . .

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir flask

# Make port 5000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 5000

# Define environment variable
ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["flask", "run"]
```

Based on proposed problem solving approaches, the state of execution, and the partial answers which can be seen in
the conversation thread, we want to determine if we are on the good track to solve the task problem and score 
the proposed approaches in the range of [0.0, 10.0], the higher the score the more preferable.

Scoring criteria: 
* If the original task problem contains error and not solvable or we are at a dead-end or infinite loop trying to 
  solve the original, then all approaches except `BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR` get 0 scores.
* Direct answers are acceptable unless the answer is incorrect in which case it should get a score of 0.
* The approaches which lead to incorrect results should get a score of 0.
* The assumption implied/used should be correct.
* The questions asked by Tao should be relevant and not trivial.
* Among `HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN` strategies, simple, generic, and high-level ones get higher scores. 
  Overly detailed, specific, and low-level ones get lower scores. Because it is impossible to backtrack and try 
  different values in detailed plans in case of errors. Likewise, choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. 
  For example, rate "Find and set missing elements to fill-in values" higher than "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22". 
  Tao is good at handling details himself.
  * Sub-steps need and should only focus on the current steps; other concerns should be addressed by higher or 
    sibling plans.
* Try to avoid identical scores (except 0's;) you can use decimal points (e.g. 9.5) to distinguish two different 
  approaches.
* Among similar approaches, mark others as duplicates of the best one; note: an approach can only duplicate another 
  approach if the two are of same kinds, e.g. two direct answers.

Response must be in valid JSON like this:

{
  "1": {"score": 9.8, "reason": "your reasoning"},
  "2": {"score": 9.65, "duplicate_of": 1, "reason": "your explanation"},
  "3": {"score": 7.5, "reason": "workable but too detail, over specific"}
}
```
