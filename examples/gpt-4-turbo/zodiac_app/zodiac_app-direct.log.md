**NOTE:**: the Zodiac sign calculation is incorrect due to wrong ordering of animals in this method. And it is not 
caught. Direct default prompt on this GPT version may also encounter this hallucination problem.

Certainly! Below is a simple Python web application using Flask that asks for the user's date of birth and renders a page showing the user's Chinese zodiac sign. The project is structured with a main application file, a template file for the HTML, and a simple CSS file for minimal styling.

### FILE: app.py
This is the main Flask application file.

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__)

# Chinese Zodiac calculation logic
zodiac_animals = [
    "Monkey", "Rooster", "Dog", "Pig", "Rat", "Ox",
    "Tiger", "Rabbit", "Dragon", "Snake", "Horse", "Goat"
]

def get_zodiac(year):
    return zodiac_animals[(year - 4) % 12]

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    zodiac_sign = None
    if request.method == 'POST':
        dob = request.form.get('dob')
        if dob:
            year = int(dob.split('-')[0])
            zodiac_sign = get_zodiac(year)
    return render_template('index.html', zodiac_sign=zodiac_sign)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### FILE: templates/index.html
This is the HTML template file for the main page.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Chinese Zodiac Sign</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='styles.css') }}">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Find Your Chinese Zodiac Sign</h1>
    <form method="post">
        <label for="dob">Enter your date of birth:</label>
        <input type="date" id="dob" name="dob" required>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
    {% if zodiac_sign %}
        <p>Your Chinese Zodiac Sign is: <strong>{{ zodiac_sign }}</strong></p>
    {% endif %}
</body>
</html>
```

### FILE: static/styles.css
This is a simple CSS file for minimal styling.

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}

h1 {
    color: #333;
}

form {
    margin: 20px 0;
}

label {
    margin-right: 10px;
}

button {
    margin-left: 10px;
}

p {
    color: #666;
    font-size: 1.2em;
}
```

To run this project, you will need to have Python and Flask installed. You can install Flask using pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

After you have Flask installed, you can run the application by executing the `app.py` file:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start a development server, and you can access it by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

***Problem Solving Instructions***



Given problem solving session so far, choose one of the following strategies:

## Strategy: Give up on errors

If you see any errors or inconsistencies, response with the list of **specific** issues in valid JSON like this:

 `````markdown
 # BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR

```json
[
  "<issue 1 with details>",
  "<issue 2 with details>",
  // ...
]
```
`````

Do NOT try to fix the errors since Orchestrator wouldn't understand. Instead it will let you try other alternatives 
later.

## Strategy: Ask Questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Use this strategy to ask questions, but avoid obvious, trivial, 
redundant, or useless questions. You should try to ask all questions you need up front. You must follow the
following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the questions to the user.

```markdown
# I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED
<optional introductory and analysis>

1. <question> [<explanation>]
2. <question> [<explanation>]
...
```

## Strategy: Step-by-step Plan

In this strategy, the current step is turned into a top-down, high-level, step-by-step plan of which you and 
Orchestrator will solve using tree traversal and backtracking.

* Think abstract. Come up with generic, and high-level. Avoid detailed, specific, fixed-value, and low-level ones. 
  Because it is impossible to backtrack and try different values in detailed plans in case of errors. Likewise, 
  choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. For example, choose "Find and set missing elements to fill-in 
  values" instead of "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22".
* Avoid loops if possible as they are less friendly to depth-first search for solution.
* Worship Occam's razor.
* Do not jump ahead. Plan only for this step.

Do NOT fill in any details and do NOT work on the plan yet, Orchestrator will prompt you to work at each step later.

Follow this markdown template:

`````markdown
# HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN

```json
{
  "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
  "2": {
        "description": "<high-level description without details>",
        "sub_steps": {
            "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
            "2": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"}
        }
       },
  // ...
}
```
`````

## Strategy: Direct Answer

If you know the correct answer to the whole problem, you can answer it directly.

Important Note: as we are giving direct answer to the whole task problem, this is the final 
step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the `NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

`````markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content section only in need of writing a file>

### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT:
None. This is the final step.
`````

If (and only if) the task requires writing files, add a Markdown `### FILE:` section for each file and put the content
in a block. Example:

````markdown

### FILE: path/to/codes.py
<short description of this file>

```text
<content of this file>
```
````



## Strategy: Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao 
solve problems. It's stateful and previously defined globals can be used without redefining.

Follow the good example below to ask Genie:
`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE

```python
def fib(n):
    return fib(n-1) + f(n-2) if n > 1 else 1
print(f"Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer! Here is the answer {fib(22)}")
```
`````

Bad example:
`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE
Here is the `fib.py` Python file you want:
```python
def fib(n): # method fib(n)
return fib(n-1) + f(n-2) if n > 1 else 1
```
`````
Issues with this example:
1. The task asks for a file but Tao attempts to execute codes; should respond using direct file section answer.
2. Not paying attention to Python indentation.
3. The code comment is redundant; avoid useless comments

Important notes:
* Respect the original task problem! Do NOT alter inadvertently.
