1. Fill in any blanks that can only be one number due to the constraints of the other numbers in their row, column, and 2x2 subgrid
2. For blanks where multiple numbers could fit, make a note of the options and choose one to proceed with
3. If a contradiction is reached, backtrack to the last decision point and try a different number
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the Sudoku is solved
5. Verify the completed Sudoku grid to ensure all rows, columns, and 2x2 subgrids contain the numbers 1 to 4 exactly once

1. Place numbers in the first subgrid (top-left 2x2) using elimination based on existing numbers
2. Place numbers in the second subgrid (top-right 2x2) using elimination based on existing numbers
3. Place numbers in the third subgrid (bottom-left 2x2) using elimination based on existing numbers
4. Place numbers in the fourth subgrid (bottom-right 2x2) using elimination based on existing numbers
5. Review and adjust the placements if necessary, ensuring that each number appears exactly once per row and column

In the first subgrid (top-left 2x2), the number 4 is already placed in the top-left cell, and the number 1 is placed in the bottom-right cell. The missing numbers in this subgrid are 2 and 3.

Since the number 2 is already in the bottom row of the grid (in the third subgrid), it cannot be in the bottom row of the first subgrid. Therefore, the number 2 must be placed in the top-right cell of the first subgrid.

Similarly, since the number 3 is already in the bottom row of the grid (in the third subgrid), it cannot be in the bottom row of the first subgrid. Therefore, the number 3 must be placed in the bottom-left cell of the first subgrid.

The first subgrid is now complete:

```
4 2
3 1
```


</div>

<div style="background-color:lightyellow; padding: 5px; border-bottom: 1px dotted grey">
<div>[4] <b>Tao</b>: </div>

In the second subgrid (top-right 2x2), the number 1 is already in the first column of the grid. Let's determine the placement of the remaining numbers 2, 3, and 4.

First, we look at the top row of the entire grid. We already have the numbers 4 and 2 in the first subgrid, so for the top row of the second subgrid, the only number left is 3. We place the number 3 in the top-left cell of the second subgrid.

Next, we look at the second row of the grid. Since the number 1 is already placed in the first column, and the number 4 can't be in the same row (as it is already in the first row of the first subgrid), the only numbers left for the second row of the second subgrid are 2 and 3. However, since we already placed a 3 in the top-left cell of this subgrid, the top-right cell must be a 2.

Now, we only have the bottom row of the second subgrid left to fill. The only numbers missing from the entire second row are 3 and 4. Since the number 3 is already in the first column of the second subgrid, the bottom-right cell must be a 4, and the bottom-left cell must be a 3.

The second subgrid is now complete:

```
3 2
1 4
```


</div>

<div style="background-color:lightyellow; padding: 5px; border-bottom: 1px dotted grey">
<div>[5] <b>Tao</b>: </div>

In the third subgrid (bottom-left 2x2), we need to place the numbers 1 and 4, as numbers 2 and 3 are already present in the bottom row of the grid.

In the third column of the grid, numbers 1 and 2 are already present in the other subgrids, so the numbers we can place in this subgrid are 3 and 4. The number 3 has to be in the bottom row because it's already in the top two rows of the third column. This places number 3 in the bottom-left cell of the third subgrid.

The number 4 has to be in the top-left cell of the third subgrid, as it's the only one left where it can go in this subgrid.

The fourth column of the grid is missing numbers 1 and 2. Since number 2 is in the bottom row of the grid, the only place left for number 1 is in the top-right cell of the third subgrid. Consequently, this places number 2 in the bottom-right cell of the third subgrid.

The third subgrid is now complete:

```
4 1
3 2
```


</div>

<div style="background-color:lightyellow; padding: 5px; border-bottom: 1px dotted grey">
<div>[6] <b>Tao</b>: </div>

In the fourth subgrid (bottom-right 2x2), we need to place the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 using elimination based on existing numbers.

Looking at the third column, we have the numbers 2 and 3 already placed in the grid. Therefore, the numbers that can go into the third column in this subgrid are 1 and 4. Since the number 4 is already in the top row of the grid, it cannot be in the top row of this subgrid. Therefore, the number 4 must be placed in the bottom-left cell of the fourth subgrid.

The number 1 must then be placed in the top-left cell of the fourth subgrid, as it's the only place left for it in the third column.

Looking at the fourth column, we have the numbers 1 and 4 already placed in the grid. Therefore, the numbers that can go into the fourth column in this subgrid are 2 and 3. Since the number 3 is already in the bottom row of the grid, it cannot be in the bottom row of this subgrid. Therefore, the number 3 must be placed in the top-right cell of the fourth subgrid.

The number 2 must then be placed in the bottom-right cell of the fourth subgrid, as it's the only place left for it in the fourth column.

The fourth subgrid is now complete:

```
1 3
4 2
```


</div>

<div style="background-color:lightyellow; padding: 5px; border-bottom: 1px dotted grey">
<div>[7] <b>Tao</b>: </div>

After reviewing and adjusting the placements, ensuring that each number appears exactly once per row and column, the completed 4x4 Sudoku grid should look like this:

```
4 2 3 1
1 3 2 4
3 4 1 2
2 1 4 3
```

Each number (1 through 4) appears exactly once in each row, column, and 2x2 subgrid.


</div>

<div style="background-color:lightyellow; padding: 5px; border-bottom: 1px dotted grey">
<div>[8] <b>Tao</b>: </div>

The completed 4x4 Sudoku grid is as follows:

```
4 2 3 1
1 3 2 4
3 4 1 2
2 1 4 3
```

Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. In the first subgrid (top-left 2x2), the number 4 is in the top-left cell, and the number 1 is in the bottom-right cell. The numbers 2 and 3 are missing. Since 2 is in the bottom row of the grid, it must go in the top row of the first subgrid, specifically the top-right cell. The number 3 must go in the bottom-left cell.

2. In the second subgrid (top-right 2x2), the number 1 is already in the first column of the grid. The top row of the second subgrid can only have a 3 because 4 and 2 are in the first subgrid. The second row of the second subgrid can only have a 2 and 4 because 1 is in the first column and 3 is in the top row of the second subgrid. Therefore, the top-right cell is 2, the bottom-right cell is 4, and the bottom-left cell is 3.

3. In the third subgrid (bottom-left 2x2), the numbers 2 and 3 are already in the bottom row of the grid. The third column can only have 3 and 4, and since 3 is in the bottom row, it must go in the bottom-left cell, and 4 must go in the top-left cell. The fourth column can only have 1 and 2, and since 2 is in the bottom row, 1 must go in the top-right cell, and 2 must go in the bottom-right cell.

4. In the fourth subgrid (bottom-right 2x2), the third column can only have 1 and 4, and since 4 cannot be in the top row, it goes in the bottom-left cell, and 1 goes in the top-left cell. The fourth column can only have 2 and 3, and since 3 cannot be in the bottom row, it goes in the top-right cell, and 2 goes in the bottom-right cell.

5. After placing all the numbers according to these rules, we verify that each number appears exactly once per row and column, as well as within each 2x2 subgrid.

This completes the 4x4 Sudoku puzzle.
