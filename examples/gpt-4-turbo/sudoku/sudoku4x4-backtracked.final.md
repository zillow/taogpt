[at step: start working on the problem]


1. Fill in the missing numbers for the second cell of each row based on the Sudoku rules
2. Fill in the missing numbers for the third cell of each row based on the Sudoku rules
3. Verify that all rows, columns, and 2x2 subgrids contain no duplicate numbers
4. Adjust the numbers if any duplicates are found, following the Sudoku rules

[at step: Fill in the missing numbers for the second cell of each row based on the Sudoku rules]

To fill in the missing numbers for the second cell of each row, we must ensure that each number is unique within its respective row, column, and 2x2 subgrid. Let's solve the Sudoku step by step:

- For the second cell in the first row (4 _ _ 1), the possible numbers for a 4x4 Sudoku are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since 4 and 1 are already in the row, and 2 is in the same column in the fourth row, the only number that can go there is 3. The first row should now look like this: 4 3 _ 1.

- For the second cell in the second row (1 _ _ _), following the same logic, we can't have 1, 2 is available, 3 is in the same column in the fourth row, and 4 is in the same column in the first row. Thus, the second cell must be 2. The second row should now look like this: 1 2 _ _.

- For the second cell in the third row (_ _ 1 _), we can see that 1 is already in the row, 2 is in the same column in the second row, 4 is in the first column, so the cell must be 3. The third row should now look like this: _ 3 1 _.

- For the second cell in the fourth row (2 _ 3 _), we know 2 is already in the row, 3 is also in the row, and 4 is in the same column in the first row. Therefore, the second cell must be 1. The fourth row should now look like this: 2 1 3 _.

The updated Sudoku grid now looks like this:

```text
4 3 _ 1
1 2 _ _
_ 3 1 _
2 1 3 _
```

***[My thought]***



[at step: Fill in the missing numbers for the third cell of each row based on the Sudoku rules]

Continuing from where we left off, let's fill in the third cell for each row:

- For the third cell in the first row (4 3 _ 1), numbers 2 and 4 are remaining. Since 4 is already in the row, the third cell must be 2. The first row now reads: 4 3 2 1.

- For the third cell in the second row (1 2 _ _), the numbers 3 and 4 are remaining. Since the third row must have a 4 in the third position (because the fourth position in that row can't be 4 as it's already present in the fourth row), the second row's third cell can't be 4 and must be 3. The second row now reads: 1 2 3 _.

- For the third cell in the third row (_ 3 1 _), the numbers 2 and 4 are remaining. Since the fourth row has a 3 in the third position, and the first row has a 2, the third cell cannot be 2 and must be 4. The third row now reads: _ 3 4 1.

- For the third row, we now know the first cell cannot be 2 because it's already in the first position in the fourth row. It must be 3. So, the third row reads: 3 3 4 1.

- However, we encounter an error here. The third row now has two 3's, which is against the rules of Sudoku. This signals that an earlier assumption must be incorrect. We need to backtrack and find where the mistake was made.

***Tao's Final Answer***



[at step: summarize final answer]

Upon revisiting the Sudoku puzzle, the correct solution is as follows:

```text
4 3 2 1
1 2 4 3
3 4 1 2
2 1 3 4
```

Each row, column, and 2x2 subgrid contains no duplicate numbers, adhering to the rules of Sudoku.
