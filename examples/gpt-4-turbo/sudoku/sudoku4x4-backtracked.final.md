***Tao's Final Answer***



[at step: start working on the problem]

To solve the given 4x4 Sudoku, we need to fill in the blanks such that each row, column, and 2x2 box contains the numbers 1 through 4 without repeating. Here's the correctly solved Sudoku:

```
4 3 2 1
1 2 4 3
3 4 1 2
2 1 3 4
```

Explanation:

- In the first row, the number 3 fits in the second column as 2, 4 are present in the same column in the second and fourth rows respectively.
- In the second row, the numbers 2 and 4 can be placed in the second and third columns as those are the only places they can go without conflict.
- The third row only has one number missing, which is number 3, and it can only go in the second column.
- In the fourth row, the number 1 fits in the second column as all other numbers are already present in the row, and the number 3 fits in the third column.

Each row, column, and 2x2 box contains the numbers 1 through 4 without repeating, so this is the solution to the given 4x4 Sudoku puzzle.
