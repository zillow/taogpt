MY_THOUGHT:
To solve the Game of 24 using the numbers 7, 6, 2, 1, we can use basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and parentheses to order the operations. Here's one possible solution:

\[ (6 \div (7 - (2 + 1))) \times 24 = 24 \]

Explanation:
1. Calculate the innermost parentheses first: \(2 + 1 = 3\).
2. Subtract this result from 7: \(7 - 3 = 4\).
3. Divide 6 by the result of the subtraction: \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\).
4. Finally, multiply this result by 24 to achieve the target number: \(1.5 \times 24 = 24\).

This solution uses each of the numbers exactly once and combines them using allowed operations to reach the target number 24.

Tao has proposed the following different choices:

[Proposal 1] MY_THOUGHT:

To solve the Game of 24 using the numbers 7, 6, 2, 1, we can use basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and parentheses to order the operations. Here's one possible solution:

\[ (6 \div (7 - (2 + 1))) \times 24 = 24 \]

1. Calculate the innermost parentheses first: \(2 + 1 = 3\).
2. Subtract this result from 7: \(7 - 3 = 4\).
3. Divide 6 by the result of the subtraction: \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\).
4. Finally, multiply this result by 24 to achieve the target number: \(1.5 \times 24 = 24\).

This solution uses each of the numbers exactly once and combines them using allowed operations to reach the target number 24.

[Proposal 2] MY_THOUGHT:

An alternative solution to solve the Game of 24 using the numbers 7, 6, 2, 1, while utilizing basic arithmetic operations and parentheses is as follows:

\[ (6 \times (2 + 1)) + 7 = 24 \]

Explanation:
1. Add 1 to 2, resulting in 3: \(2 + 1 = 3\).
2. Multiply this sum by 6: \(6 \times 3 = 18\).
3. Finally, add 7 to the result: \(18 + 7 = 24\).

This solution also uses each of the numbers exactly once and combines them using allowed operations to reach the target number 24, providing an alternative method to reach the same result.



---

[Proposal 3] MY_THOUGHT:

Here is another valid solution to solve the Game of 24 using the numbers 7, 6, 2, 1:

\[ (6 \times (2 + 1)) - (7 - 1) = 24 \]

Explanation:
1. Add 2 to 1, resulting in 3: \(2 + 1 = 3\).
2. Multiply this sum by 6: \(6 \times 3 = 18\).
3. Subtract 1 from 7, resulting in 6: \(7 - 1 = 6\).
4. Finally, subtract the result of the subtraction from the multiplication result: \(18 - 6 = 24\).

This solution uses each of the numbers exactly once and combines them using allowed operations to reach the target number 24, providing yet another method to achieve the desired outcome.
