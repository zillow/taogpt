I apologize for the oversight. To provide accurate information, it's important to verify the exact location of Huawei's headquarters in Shenzhen. Huawei has multiple campuses in Shenzhen, with the main ones being:

1. **Bantian Campus**: Located in Longgang District, this is often referred to as Huawei's headquarters. It's a large campus that serves as the main research and development center.

2. **Songshan Lake Campus**: Situated in Dongguan, near Shenzhen, this campus is designed to resemble European towns and serves as an additional R&D and manufacturing base.

3. **Southern Factory**: Located in the Nanshan District, this site is closer to the city center and focuses on high-tech innovation.

Given this information, it's crucial to confirm with your employer which campus you will be working at before deciding on where to live. If you will be working at the Bantian Campus in Longgang District, then the previous recommendations would apply. However, if you will be working at the Southern Factory in Nanshan District or another location, your housing search would need to be adjusted accordingly.

Once the exact workplace location is confirmed, you can then proceed with the housing search, taking into account the proximity to the subway, your budget, and the availability of amenities. It's recommended to use online housing platforms or contact local real estate agents to find the most up-to-date listings that match your criteria.

Considering your workplace at Huawei and your preference for using the subway, here are some neighborhoods that you might want to consider:

1. **Nanshan District**: This is a well-developed area with a vibrant expat community and plenty of dining and entertainment options. It's well-connected by the subway, although it might be a bit pricier. Look for areas close to the Shenzhen Metro Line 5, which can take you towards the Longgang District.

2. **Futian District**: As the central business district of Shenzhen, Futian is very modern and has excellent subway connections. It's home to many shopping malls, restaurants, and parks. The area is served by several metro lines, including Line 3, which connects to Line 5 for access to Huawei's headquarters.

3. **Longgang District**: Living in the same district as Huawei's headquarters could be very convenient. Longgang is more suburban and might offer more spacious living options within your budget. The area is served by Shenzhen Metro Line 3, which connects to Line 5.

4. **Luohu District**: This is one of the older and more established areas of Shenzhen, with a mix of residential and commercial spaces. It has good subway connections and might offer more affordable housing options. You can take Line 3 and transfer to Line 5 to reach Huawei.

When searching for an apartment, you should look for proximity to the subway stations on Line 5 or those that allow an easy transfer to Line 5, as this will be your primary route to work. Keep in mind that Shenzhen's subway system is extensive and efficient, so living a few stops away from a direct line to Huawei can still be a convenient option.

Given your budget of $1000 for housing, you will likely be looking at apartments rather than houses, as single-family homes in Shenzhen are indeed quite expensive. In terms of neighborhoods, your budget is more suited to areas that are slightly away from the city center or in emerging districts.

In the Nanshan District, you might find some studio or one-bedroom apartments within your budget, but they may be on the smaller side given that Nanshan is a more upscale area. Futian District, being the central business district, might also offer some options, but again, these are likely to be compact due to the premium location.

Longgang District, where Huawei's headquarters is located, is more suburban and may offer larger apartments for your budget. Since it's further from the city center, the cost of living is generally lower, and you might get better value for money in terms of space and amenities.

Luohu District, being one of the older districts, might have some affordable options as well. The apartments here could be older but might offer more space for the price compared to the newer, more central districts.

Overall, Longgang and Luohu are likely to provide more options within your budget, with Longgang offering the added convenience of being close to your workplace. It's recommended to use online housing platforms or get in touch with local real estate agents to get a clearer picture of the current rental market and find the best deals within your budget.

As an AI language model, I don't have the capability to browse the internet or access current databases for live apartment listings. However, to look for apartment listings in the filtered neighborhoods of Shenzhen, you would typically follow these steps:

1. Visit popular real estate websites that cater to Shenzhen, such as 58.com, Anjuke, or Ziroom. These platforms often have English versions or can be navigated with the help of online translation tools.

2. Use search filters on these websites to narrow down your options to the Longgang District, Nanshan District, Futian District, and Luohu District, with a focus on proximity to subway lines, especially Line 5 for Longgang.

3. Set your budget to a maximum of $1000 to see what types of apartments are available within this price range.

4. Look for listings that provide clear photos, detailed descriptions, and information about the surrounding area, including dining options and other amenities.

5. Save or bookmark listings that meet your criteria for further review or to contact the listing agents for more information and to schedule viewings.

Remember to also check expat forums, social media groups, and local community boards, as they can be valuable resources for finding housing and getting advice from people who have gone through the process in Shenzhen.

When considering the proximity of dining options and other amenities in the selected neighborhoods of Shenzhen, it's important to note that Shenzhen is a modern, bustling city with a wide array of dining choices ranging from street food to high-end restaurants. 

In the Nanshan District, you'll find a mix of local eateries and international cuisine, reflecting the area's expat-friendly environment. This district is known for its shopping malls and commercial areas, such as Coastal City, which host a variety of dining options.

Futian District, being the central business district, is packed with restaurants, cafes, and bars. The area around the Convention and Exhibition Center is particularly known for its diverse food scene.

Longgang District, where Huawei's headquarters is located, also has a variety of dining options, especially in the areas closer to the city center. As a more residential and suburban district, Longgang offers a mix of traditional Chinese restaurants and some international options.

Luohu District, one of the older districts, has a rich array of dining choices, including some of Shenzhen's most famous street food and traditional Cantonese restaurants. Dongmen Pedestrian Street in Luohu is a popular spot for food lovers.

Each of these neighborhoods also has supermarkets, convenience stores, and other amenities like gyms, parks, and hospitals, ensuring that you'll have easy access to everything you need. When choosing a specific apartment within these districts, you can check online maps or local apps like Dianping to see the exact locations of these amenities relative to your potential new home.

Based on the information provided and your requirements, here's a summary of the findings to help you make an informed decision about where to settle in Shenzhen:

- **Budget**: With a budget of $1000 for housing, you will likely be looking at one-bedroom or studio apartments, as single-family homes are generally not within this price range in Shenzhen.

- **Location**: Considering your workplace at Huawei, which is located in the Longgang District, it would be convenient to find housing in the same district or in areas with easy subway access to Longgang.

- **Districts to Consider**:
  - **Longgang District**: Offers proximity to Huawei's headquarters and may provide larger apartments within your budget due to its more suburban nature. Look for apartments near subway stations on Line 3, which connects to Line 5 for Huawei.
  - **Nanshan District**: Known for its expat-friendly environment and amenities, but apartments might be smaller or slightly above budget.
  - **Futian District**: The central business district with a vibrant lifestyle and good subway connectivity, though living spaces may be compact.
  - **Luohu District**: An older district with potentially more affordable and spacious options, but with a longer commute to Huawei.

- **Amenities**: All the recommended districts have a good selection of dining options, from local eateries to international cuisine, as well as other amenities like shopping centers, parks, and hospitals.

- **Transportation**: You prefer to take the subway, so proximity to a subway station, particularly one on Line 5 or with easy transfers to Line 5, is essential.

- **Housing Type**: Apartments are the most realistic option within your budget, and you can find both furnished and unfurnished options depending on the district and specific location.

- **Commute**: You have not specified a maximum acceptable commute time, but considering the efficiency of Shenzhen's subway system, a commute of up to 45 minutes to an hour could be reasonable and would expand your housing options.

In conclusion, Longgang District could be the most practical choice due to its proximity to Huawei and potential for larger living spaces within your budget. However, if you prefer a more urban environment and don't mind a smaller apartment, Nanshan and Futian are also viable options.

Based on your requirements and preferences, here is a comprehensive recommendation for your relocation to Shenzhen:

**Budget**: With a budget of $1000 per month for housing, you will be looking at one-bedroom or studio apartments, as houses are typically not within this price range in Shenzhen.

**Workplace Proximity**: Since you will be working at Huawei, it is important to consider the Longgang District, where Huawei's main campus is located. This will minimize your commute time and provide you with more convenience.

**Recommended Districts**:
1. **Longgang District**: This district is suburban, which means you may find larger apartments within your budget. It is also where Huawei's headquarters is located, making it a convenient option for you. Look for apartments near subway stations on Line 3, which connects to Line 5, leading to Huawei.

2. **Nanshan District**: This is an expat-friendly area with plenty of dining and entertainment options. It is well-connected by the subway, but the cost of living is higher, so apartments may be smaller or slightly above budget.

3. **Futian District**: As the central business district, Futian offers a modern lifestyle and excellent subway connectivity. However, the apartments here may be more compact due to the premium location.

4. **Luohu District**: This older district may offer more affordable and spacious housing options, but it would result in a longer commute to Huawei's campus.

**Amenities**: All the recommended districts have a wealth of dining options, from local Chinese cuisine to international restaurants, as well as other amenities like shopping centers, parks, and hospitals.

**Transportation**: Since you prefer to take the subway, proximity to a subway station is crucial. All the recommended districts have good access to Shenzhen's subway system, with particular attention to Line 5 or lines that allow easy transfers to Line 5, which is the line you would likely use to get to Huawei.

**Housing Type**: Apartments are the most feasible housing type within your budget. You can find both furnished and unfurnished options, depending on the district and specific location.

**Commute Consideration**: While you have not specified a maximum acceptable commute time, a commute of up to 45 minutes to an hour is reasonable in Shenzhen, given the efficiency of the subway system.

In conclusion, the Longgang District is the most practical choice for you, considering the proximity to your workplace at Huawei and the potential for larger living spaces within your budget. However, if you prefer a more urban environment and are willing to compromise on space, Nanshan and Futian are also good options. Luohu is an option if you prioritize affordability and space over a shorter commute.

To find the most up-to-date apartment listings that match your criteria, it is recommended to use online real estate platforms popular in Shenzhen, such as 58.com, Anjuke, or Ziroom, and to consider engaging with a local real estate agent. They can provide you with tailored options and assist with the viewing and rental process.
