To calculate the 51st Fibonacci number, we can use a simple iterative approach. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

with initial conditions:

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1

Here's a Python function to calculate the 51st Fibonacci number:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n-1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a

# Calculate the 51st Fibonacci number
fib_51 = fibonacci(51)
print(fib_51)
```

When you run this code, it will print the 51st Fibonacci number.

***Problem Solving Instructions***



Given problem solving session so far, choose one of the following strategies:

## Strategy: Give up on errors

If you see any errors or inconsistencies, response with the list of **specific** issues in valid JSON like this:

 `````markdown
 # BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR

```json
[
  "<issue 1 with details>",
  "<issue 2 with details>",
  // ...
]
```
`````

Do NOT try to fix the errors since Orchestrator wouldn't understand. Instead it will let you try other alternatives 
later.

## Strategy: Ask Questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Use this strategy to ask questions, but avoid obvious, trivial, 
redundant, or useless questions. You should try to ask all questions you need up front. You must follow the
following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the questions to the user.

```markdown
# I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED
<optional introductory and analysis>

1. <question> [<explanation>]
2. <question> [<explanation>]
...
```

## Strategy: Step-by-step Plan

In this strategy, the current step is turned into a top-down, high-level, step-by-step plan of which you and 
Orchestrator will solve using tree traversal and backtracking.

* Think abstract. Come up with generic, and high-level. Avoid detailed, specific, fixed-value, and low-level ones. 
  Because it is impossible to backtrack and try different values in detailed plans in case of errors. Likewise, 
  choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. For example, choose "Find and set missing elements to fill-in 
  values" instead of "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22".
* Avoid loops if possible as they are less friendly to depth-first search for solution.
* Worship Occam's razor.
* Don't jump ahead. Plan **only for this step** and not something else from the higher plans.

Do NOT fill in any details and do NOT work on the plan yet, Orchestrator will prompt you to work at each step later.

Follow this markdown template:

`````markdown
# HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN

```json
{
  "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
  "2": {
        "description": "<high-level description without details>",
        "sub_steps": {
            "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
            "2": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"}
        }
       },
  // ...
}
```
`````

## Strategy: Direct Answer

If you know the correct answer to the whole problem, you can answer it directly.

Important Note: as we are giving direct answer to the whole task problem, this is the final 
step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the `NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

`````markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content section only in need of writing a file>

### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT:
None. This is the final step.
`````

If (and only if) the task requires writing files, add a Markdown `### FILE:` section for each file and put the content
in a block. Example:

````markdown

### FILE: path/to/codes.py
<short description of this file>

```python
<content of this file>
```
````



## Strategy: Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao 
solve problems. It's stateful and previously defined globals can be used without redefining.

Follow the good example below to ask Genie:
`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE

```python
def fib(n):
    return fib(n-1) + f(n-2) if n > 1 else 1
print(f"Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer! Here is the answer {fib(22)}")
```
`````

Bad example:
`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE
Here is the `fib.py` Python file you want:
```python
def fib(n): # method fib(n)
return fib(n-1) + f(n-2) if n > 1 else 1
```
`````
Issues with this example:
1. The task asks for a file but Tao attempts to execute codes; should respond using direct file section answer.
2. Not paying attention to Python indentation.
3. The code comment is redundant; avoid useless comments

Important notes:
* Respect the original task problem! Do NOT alter inadvertently.

Your name is Sage. You're a serious critic who carefully analyzes problem solving strategies and solutions and give 
out criticism and opinions for the problem solver. At each step, The problem solver, whose name is Tao, should 
provide either a direct answer for that step, a step-by-step plan, invoke helper, or asking questions.

Tao has proposed the following different approaches:

***[Approach 1] LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE***



[at step: start working on the problem]

Python Genie, Python Genie, run the Python snippet underneath:

```python
def fib(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 2:
        return 1
    memo[n] = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo)
    return memo[n]

print(f"The 51st Fibonacci number is: {fib(51)}")
```

---

***[Approach 2] [My thought]***



[at step: start working on the problem]

To calculate the 51st Fibonacci number, we can use a simple iterative approach. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

with initial conditions:

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1

Here's a Python function to calculate the 51st Fibonacci number:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n-1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a

# Calculate the 51st Fibonacci number
fib_51 = fibonacci(51)
print(fib_51)
```

When you run this code, it will print the 51st Fibonacci number.

---

Based on proposed problem solving approaches, the state of execution, and the partial answers which can be seen in
the conversation thread, we want to determine if we are on the good track to solve the task problem and score 
the proposed approaches in the range of [0.0, 10.0], the higher the score the more preferable.

Scoring criteria: 
* If the original task problem contains error and not solvable or we are at a dead-end or infinite loop trying to 
  solve the original, then all approaches except `BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR` get 0 scores.
* Direct answers are acceptable unless the answer is incorrect in which case it should get a score of 0.
* The approaches which lead to incorrect results should get a score of 0.
* The assumption implied/used should be correct.
* The questions asked by Tao should be relevant and not trivial.
* Among `HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN` strategies, simple, generic, and high-level ones get higher scores. 
  Overly detailed, specific, and low-level ones get lower scores. Because it is impossible to backtrack and try 
  different values in detailed plans in case of errors. Likewise, choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. 
  For example, rate "Find and set missing elements to fill-in values" higher than "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22". 
  Tao is good at handling details himself.
* Try to avoid identical scores (except 0's;) you can use decimal points (e.g. 9.5) to distinguish two different 
  approaches.
* Among similar approaches, mark others as duplicates of the best one; note: an approach can only duplicate another 
  approach if the two are of same kinds, e.g. two direct answers.

Tao has proposed the following different approaches:

***[Approach 1] [My thought]***



[at step: None. This is the final step]

The 51st Fibonacci number is 20365011074. This was calculated using a recursive function with memoization to efficiently compute large Fibonacci numbers without recalculating the smaller ones multiple times.

---

***[Approach 2] [My thought]***



[at step: None. This is the final step]

The 51st Fibonacci number is: 20365011074

---

Based on proposed problem solving approaches, the state of execution, and the partial answers which can be seen in
the conversation thread, we want to determine if we are on the good track to solve the task problem and score 
the proposed approaches in the range of [0.0, 10.0], the higher the score the more preferable.

Scoring criteria: 
* If the original task problem contains error and not solvable or we are at a dead-end or infinite loop trying to 
  solve the original, then all approaches except `BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR` get 0 scores.
* Direct answers are acceptable unless the answer is incorrect in which case it should get a score of 0.
* The approaches which lead to incorrect results should get a score of 0.
* The assumption implied/used should be correct.
* The questions asked by Tao should be relevant and not trivial.
* Among `HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN` strategies, simple, generic, and high-level ones get higher scores. 
  Overly detailed, specific, and low-level ones get lower scores. Because it is impossible to backtrack and try 
  different values in detailed plans in case of errors. Likewise, choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. 
  For example, rate "Find and set missing elements to fill-in values" higher than "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22". 
  Tao is good at handling details himself.
* Try to avoid identical scores (except 0's;) you can use decimal points (e.g. 9.5) to distinguish two different 
  approaches.
* Among similar approaches, mark others as duplicates of the best one; note: an approach can only duplicate another 
  approach if the two are of same kinds, e.g. two direct answers.

Tao, the above is your final problem solving trajectory. Present a final answer to the user. The user would not read 
the problem solving session, so make sure to include **full and complete** details requested by the task problem.

Start with heading `# FINAL_ANSWER`.

If the task involves writing out files, make sure to fill in any missing files or contents. But to save spaces, 
don't repeat unchanged file contents. You should write out files in the `### FILE:` sections. Do not repeat any file 
contents outside of the file sections.

## Response Template and Example

In the example summary below, Orchestrator details the problem solving steps and lists this file written:

`````markdown
... steps during problem solving ...

---

### FILE: existing_file.py
```python
def do_something():
    ...
```
`````

And Tao summarizes to:

````markdown
# FINAL_ANSWER

```python
def do_something(p1, p2):
    ...
```

### FILE: new_file.py 
```python
def do_something_else():
    ...
```
````

* Good: writing out new file missing from the problem solving session in `### FILE:` sections.
* Bad: repeating unchanged content of existing file.
* Bad: file content outside of `### FILE:` section.
* Bad: no full answer given.
