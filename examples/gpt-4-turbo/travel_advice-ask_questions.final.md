[at step: response to start working on the problem]

Considering your preference to arrive in Moscow during the summer and your ample budget, here is a revised route plan that avoids air travel:

***Urumqi to Almaty***


**Option 1: Bus**
- Take a long-distance bus from Urumqi to Almaty, Kazakhstan. This journey can take approximately 24 hours.

**Option 2: Train**
- Alternatively, take a train from Urumqi to Almaty. The train journey might be more comfortable and can take around the same time as the bus.

***Almaty to Nur-Sultan (Astana)***


- From Almaty, take a domestic train to Nur-Sultan, the capital of Kazakhstan. The train journey can take about 12-14 hours.

***Nur-Sultan to Moscow***


- From Nur-Sultan, board a direct train to Moscow. This is a long journey that can take approximately 2-3 days, depending on the train service you choose.

***Alternative Route via China and Mongolia (Scenic Route)***


If you're interested in a more scenic route and don't mind a longer journey, you can travel through China and Mongolia before entering Russia.

- **Urumqi to Beijing by Train**
  - Take a train from Urumqi to Beijing, which can take about 30-40 hours.

- **Beijing to Ulaanbaatar by Train**
  - From Beijing, take the Trans-Mongolian Railway to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. This leg of the journey can take about 30 hours.

- **Ulaanbaatar to Moscow by Train**
  - From Ulaanbaatar, take the Trans-Mongolian Railway directly to Moscow. This part of the trip can take about 4-5 days.

***Timing Your Journey for Summer Arrival***


- Plan to start your journey at least 2 weeks before your desired arrival time in Moscow to account for the travel time and any potential delays.
- The summer months in Moscow are June, July, and August. To enjoy the full summer experience, consider starting your journey in early June.

***Important Notes***


- **Visas**: Ensure you have the necessary visas for Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and Russia before you start your journey.
- **Train Classes**: Choose a comfortable class for the long train journeys, such as a sleeper cabin.
- **Border Crossings**: Be prepared for border control procedures, which can be time-consuming.
- **Language**: Consider learning basic phrases or carrying a phrasebook for the languages spoken in the countries you'll pass through.
- **Currency**: Make sure to have some local currency for each country for small expenses.
- **Travel Insurance**: It's advisable to have comprehensive travel insurance for such a long overland journey.

Please note that this route plan is based on the assumption that the train and bus services are operating normally. It's important to check the availability and schedule of these services closer to your departure date, as they can change due to various factors. Since you mentioned that you have a lot of money, you may opt for higher-class accommodations on trains for a more comfortable journey. Enjoy your trip!
