I want to travel to Moscow. I just need a detailed route plan. 
(I don't need the actual schedule. And you don't have access to the internet.)

I apologize for the oversight. Without access to the internet and specific train schedules, I can provide a more generalized route plan with the understanding that you will need to obtain the exact train numbers, departure times, and transfer details locally at the train stations or through a travel agency. Here is a revised, simplified route plan:

***Urumqi to Lhasa***


1. **Train from Urumqi to Xining**: Board a train from Urumqi to Xining. This leg of the journey will take about a day. Look for a train that offers soft sleeper compartments for comfort.

2. **Train from Xining to Lhasa**: From Xining, take the train to Lhasa on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. This journey will take roughly a day and offers breathtaking views of the Tibetan Plateau. Again, choose a soft sleeper for the best comfort.

***Lhasa to Moscow***


The journey from Lhasa to Moscow will involve multiple train changes and countries:

1. **Train from Lhasa to Beijing**: Take a train from Lhasa back to Beijing. This trip will take approximately two days. A soft sleeper compartment is recommended.

2. **Train from Beijing to Ulaanbaatar**: From Beijing, board the train to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. This journey will take about a day and a half.

3. **Train from Ulaanbaatar to Irkutsk**: After arriving in Ulaanbaatar, find a train to Irkutsk, Russia. This leg will take about a day.

4. **Train from Irkutsk to Moscow**: Finally, from Irkutsk, you will embark on the Trans-Siberian Railway to Moscow. This is the longest leg, taking approximately three to four days. A first-class cabin is suggested for maximum comfort.

Please ensure to check for the most recent train schedules and availability at local train stations or through a travel agency. You will also need to arrange visas for China, Mongolia, and Russia in advance, and consider accommodations for overnight stops or layovers. It's important to book your train tickets as early as possible, especially if you are looking for sleeper compartments, to ensure a comfortable journey.

Based on your starting location in Urumqi and your preference to avoid flying, as well as your desire to visit Lhasa and preference for comfort and minimal hassle, here is a detailed route plan for your journey to Moscow:

**Urumqi to Lhasa:**
1. **Urumqi to Xining**: Begin your journey by taking a train from Urumqi to Xining. This leg of the journey will take approximately one day. Since you prefer comfort, it is recommended to book a soft sleeper compartment for this trip. You will need to check the local train station or contact a travel agency for the exact train options and schedules.

2. **Xining to Lhasa**: From Xining, you will transfer to the train bound for Lhasa on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. This journey will also take roughly one day. The soft sleeper compartment is advisable for this leg as well, providing both comfort and an opportunity to enjoy the scenic views of the Tibetan Plateau.

**Lhasa to Moscow:**
1. **Lhasa to Beijing**: After your visit to Lhasa, you will need to take a train back to Beijing. This trip will take approximately two days. A soft sleeper compartment is recommended for a comfortable journey. Please note that you may need to transfer in Xining again.

2. **Beijing to Ulaanbaatar**: From Beijing, you will take a train to Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia. This journey will take about one and a half days. Booking a soft sleeper will ensure a comfortable trip.

3. **Ulaanbaatar to Irkutsk**: Upon arrival in Ulaanbaatar, you will find a train to Irkutsk, Russia. This leg will take about one day. As with previous legs, a soft sleeper is suggested for comfort.

4. **Irkutsk to Moscow**: The final leg of your journey will be aboard the Trans-Siberian Railway from Irkutsk to Moscow. This is the longest part of the trip, taking approximately three to four days. Opting for a first-class cabin will provide the highest level of comfort for this extended journey.

**Additional Considerations:**
- **Visas**: You will need to secure visas for China, Mongolia, and Russia well in advance of your trip. This process can be complex and time-consuming, so it's important to start early. Contact the respective embassies or consulates for guidance on the application process.

- **Train Tickets**: Without internet access, you will need to purchase your train tickets directly at the train stations or through a travel agency. It's crucial to book these as early as possible, especially if you are looking for sleeper compartments, which are in high demand.

- **Accommodations**: For overnight stops or layovers, you may want to book hotels near the train stations for convenience. Since you do not have internet access, you can arrange your accommodations through a travel agency or by contacting hotels directly via phone.

- **Travel Advisories and Entry Requirements**: Check for any travel advisories and entry requirements for each country you will be visiting. This information can be obtained from embassies, consulates, or travel agencies.

- **Local Assistance**: Since you do not have internet access, it is advisable to seek assistance from local travel agencies or train station information desks throughout your journey. They can provide up-to-date schedules, ticket availability, and help with accommodations.

Please ensure that you have all the necessary documentation, including passports and visas, and that you are aware of the local COVID-19 regulations and travel restrictions that may be in place during your journey. Safe travels!
