To identify which rows and columns are already occupied by the existing queens and which are still available, we can start by noting the positions of the queens:

- Queen at row 1, column 3.
- Queen at row 4, column 2.

From this, we can determine:
- Occupied rows: 1 and 4
- Occupied columns: 3 and 2

Available rows are therefore 2 and 3, and available columns are 1 and 4. This information will help us in placing the remaining queens without conflicts.

[at step#5: Determine the diagonals that are already threatened by the existing queens.]

To determine the diagonals that are already threatened by the existing queens, we need to consider both the major and minor diagonals for each queen:

1. **Queen at row 1, column 3**:
   - Major diagonal (bottom-left to top-right): This diagonal can be represented by cells where the difference between the row and column numbers is constant. For this queen, \(1 - 3 = -2\). Thus, any cell (r, c) where \(r - c = -2\) is threatened.
   - Minor diagonal (top-left to bottom-right): This diagonal can be represented by cells where the sum of the row and column numbers is constant. For this queen, \(1 + 3 = 4\). Thus, any cell (r, c) where \(r + c = 4\) is threatened.

2. **Queen at row 4, column 2**:
   - Major diagonal: For this queen, \(4 - 2 = 2\). Thus, any cell (r, c) where \(r - c = 2\) is threatened.
   - Minor diagonal: For this queen, \(4 + 2 = 6\). Thus, any cell (r, c) where \(r + c = 6\) is threatened.

With this information, we can now visualize the board and see which diagonals are safe for placing the remaining queens. This will help in the next steps to find suitable positions for the third and fourth queens.

   - Minor diagonal: For this queen, \(4 + 2 = 6\). Thus, any cell (r, c) where \(r + c = 6\) is threatened.

[at step#10: Place the third queen in an available, non-threatened position.]

Given the available rows (2 and 3) and columns (1 and 4), and considering the threatened diagonals from the existing queens:
- Diagonals threatened by the queen at (1,3): r - c = -2 (e.g., (3,1)) and r + c = 4 (e.g., (2,2))
- Diagonals threatened by the queen at (4,2): r - c = 2 (e.g., (3,1)) and r + c = 6 (e.g., (3,3))

We need to find a position for the third queen that is not on these threatened diagonals and is in the available rows and columns. Let's analyze the possibilities:
- Position (2,1): 
  - r - c = 2 - 1 = 1 (not threatened)
  - r + c = 2 + 1 = 3 (not threatened)
- Position (2,4): 
  - r - c = 2 - 4 = -2 (threatened by queen at (1,3))
  - r + c = 2 + 4 = 6 (threatened by queen at (4,2))
- Position (3,1): 
  - r - c = 3 - 1 = 2 (threatened by queen at (4,2))
  - r + c = 3 + 1 = 4 (threatened by queen at (1,3))
- Position (3,4): 
  - r - c = 3 - 4 = -1 (not threatened)
  - r + c = 3 + 4 = 7 (not threatened)

From this analysis, the available positions for the third queen that are not threatened are (2,1) and (3,4). We can choose either of these positions for the third queen. Let's place the third queen at (2,1) for this solution. This choice leaves row 3 and column 4 available for the fourth queen, which we will analyze next.

[at step#2: top-level plan/answer]

To solve the 4-queen problem with the given initial placements and ensuring that no two queens threaten each other, we'll proceed with the following high-level steps.

1. Identify which rows and columns are already occupied by the existing queens and which are still available
2. Determine the diagonals that are already threatened by the existing queens
3. Place the third queen in an available, non-threatened position
4. Repeat the process to place the fourth queen ensuring no threats from the previously placed queens

[at step#4: Identify which rows and columns are already occupied by the existing queens and which are still available.]

To identify which rows and columns are already occupied by the existing queens and which are still available, we can start by noting the positions of the queens:

- Queen at row 1, column 3.
- Queen at row 4, column 2.

From this, we can determine:
- Occupied rows: 1 and 4
- Occupied columns: 3 and 2

Available rows are therefore 2 and 3, and available columns are 1 and 4. This information will help us in placing the remaining queens without conflicts.

[at step#7: Determine the diagonals that are already threatened by the existing queens.]

To determine the diagonals that are already threatened by the existing queens, we need to consider both the major and minor diagonals for each queen:

1. **Queen at row 1, column 3**:
   - Major diagonal (bottom-left to top-right): This diagonal can be represented by cells where the difference between the row and column numbers is constant. For this queen, \(1 - 3 = -2\). Thus, any cell (r, c) where \(r - c = -2\) is threatened.
   - Minor diagonal (top-left to bottom-right): This diagonal can be represented by cells where the sum of the row and column numbers is constant. For this queen, \(1 + 3 = 4\). Thus, any cell (r, c) where \(r + c = 4\) is threatened.

2. **Queen at row 4, column 2**:
   - Major diagonal: For this queen, \(4 - 2 = 2\). Thus, any cell (r, c) where \(r - c = 2\) is threatened.
   - Minor diagonal: For this queen, \(4 + 2 = 6\). Thus, any cell (r, c) where \(r + c = 6\) is threatened.

With this information, we can now visualize the board and see which diagonals are safe for placing the remaining queens. This will help in the next steps to find suitable positions for the third and fourth queens.

[at step#10: Place the third queen in an available, non-threatened position.]

Given the available rows (2 and 3) and columns (1 and 4), and considering the threatened diagonals from the existing queens:
- Diagonals threatened by the queen at (1,3): r - c = -2 (e.g., (3,1)) and r + c = 4 (e.g., (2,2))
- Diagonals threatened by the queen at (4,2): r - c = 2 (e.g., (3,1)) and r + c = 6 (e.g., (3,3))

We need to find a position for the third queen that is not on these threatened diagonals and is in the available rows and columns. Let's analyze the possibilities:
- Position (2,1): 
  - r - c = 2 - 1 = 1 (not threatened)
  - r + c = 2 + 1 = 3 (not threatened)
- Position (2,4): 
  - r - c = 2 - 4 = -2 (threatened by queen at (1,3))
  - r + c = 2 + 4 = 6 (threatened by queen at (4,2))
- Position (3,1): 
  - r - c = 3 - 1 = 2 (threatened by queen at (4,2))
  - r + c = 3 + 1 = 4 (threatened by queen at (1,3))
- Position (3,4): 
  - r - c = 3 - 4 = -1 (not threatened)
  - r + c = 3 + 4 = 7 (not threatened)

From this analysis, the available positions for the third queen that are not threatened are (2,1) and (3,4). We can choose either of these positions for the third queen. Let's place the third queen at (2,1) for this solution. This choice leaves row 3 and column 4 available for the fourth queen, which we will analyze next.

[at step#13: Repeat the process to place the fourth queen ensuring no threats from the previously placed queens.]

With the third queen successfully placed at (2,1), we now need to place the fourth queen. The remaining available position is in row 3 and column 4. Before finalizing this placement, we must ensure that this position is not threatened by any of the previously placed queens:

1. **Queen at row 1, column 3**:
   - Major diagonal: r - c = 1 - 3 = -2 (does not threaten (3,4))
   - Minor diagonal: r + c = 1 + 3 = 4 (does not threaten (3,4))

2. **Queen at row 4, column 2**:
   - Major diagonal: r - c = 4 - 2 = 2 (does not threaten (3,4))
   - Minor diagonal: r + c = 4 + 2 = 6 (does not threaten (3,4))

3. **Queen at row 2, column 1**:
   - Major diagonal: r - c = 2 - 1 = 1 (does not threaten (3,4))
   - Minor diagonal: r + c = 2 + 1 = 3 (does not threaten (3,4))

Since the position (3,4) is not threatened by any of the existing queens, we can safely place the fourth queen there. This completes the placement of all four queens on the board without any conflicts.

- Position (2,4):

[at step#4: Identify which rows and columns are already occupied by the existing queens and which are still available.]

To identify which rows and columns are already occupied by the existing queens and which are still available, we can start by noting the positions of the queens:

- Queen at row 1, column 3.
- Queen at row 4, column 2.

From this, we can determine:
- Occupied rows: 1 and 4
- Occupied columns: 3 and 2

Available rows are therefore 2 and 3, and available columns are 1 and 4. This information will help us in placing the remaining queens without conflicts.

[at step#7: Determine the diagonals that are already threatened by the existing queens.]

To determine the diagonals that are already threatened by the existing queens, we need to consider both the major and minor diagonals for each queen:

1. **Queen at row 1, column 3**:
   - Major diagonal (bottom-left to top-right): This diagonal can be represented by cells where the difference between the row and column numbers is constant. For this queen, \(1 - 3 = -2\). Thus, any cell (r, c) where \(r - c = -2\) is threatened.
   - Minor diagonal (top-left to bottom-right): This diagonal can be represented by cells where the sum of the row and column numbers is constant. For this queen, \(1 + 3 = 4\). Thus, any cell (r, c) where \(r + c = 4\) is threatened.

2. **Queen at row 4, column 2**:
   - Major diagonal: For this queen, \(4 - 2 = 2\). Thus, any cell (r, c) where \(r - c = 2\) is threatened.
   - Minor diagonal: For this queen, \(4 + 2 = 6\). Thus, any cell (r, c) where \(r + c = 6\) is threatened.

With this information, we can now visualize the board and see which diagonals are safe for placing the remaining queens. This will help in the next steps to find suitable positions for the third and fourth queens.

[at step#10: Place the third queen in an available, non-threatened position.]

Given the available rows (2 and 3) and columns (1 and 4), and considering the threatened diagonals from the existing queens:
- Diagonals threatened by the queen at (1,3): r - c = -2 (e.g., (3,1)) and r + c = 4 (e.g., (2,2))
- Diagonals threatened by the queen at (4,2): r - c = 2 (e.g., (3,1)) and r + c = 6 (e.g., (3,3))

We need to find a position for the third queen that is not on these threatened diagonals and is in the available rows and columns. Let's analyze the possibilities:
- Position (2,1): 
  - r - c = 2 - 1 = 1 (not threatened)
  - r + c = 2 + 1 = 3 (not threatened)
- Position (2,4): 
  - r - c = 2 - 4 = -2 (threatened by queen at (1,3))
  - r + c = 2 + 4 = 6 (threatened by queen at (4,2))
- Position (3,1): 
  - r - c = 3 - 1 = 2 (threatened by queen at (4,2))
  - r + c = 3 + 1 = 4 (threatened by queen at (1,3))
- Position (3,4): 
  - r - c = 3 - 4 = -1 (not threatened)
  - r + c = 3 + 4 = 7 (not threatened)

From this analysis, the available positions for the third queen that are not threatened are (2,1) and (3,4). We can choose either of these positions for the third queen. Let's place the third queen at (2,1) for this solution. This choice leaves row 3 and column 4 available for the fourth queen, which we will analyze next.

[at step#13: Repeat the process to place the fourth queen ensuring no threats from the previously placed queens.]

With the third queen successfully placed at (2,1), we now need to place the fourth queen. The remaining available position is in row 3 and column 4. Before finalizing this placement, we must ensure that this position is not threatened by any of the previously placed queens:

1. **Queen at row 1, column 3**:
   - Major diagonal: r - c = 1 - 3 = -2 (does not threaten (3,4))
   - Minor diagonal: r + c = 1 + 3 = 4 (does not threaten (3,4))

2. **Queen at row 4, column 2**:
   - Major diagonal: r - c = 4 - 2 = 2 (does not threaten (3,4))
   - Minor diagonal: r + c = 4 + 2 = 6 (does not threaten (3,4))

3. **Queen at row 2, column 1**:
   - Major diagonal: r - c = 2 - 1 = 1 (does not threaten (3,4))
   - Minor diagonal: r + c = 2 + 1 = 3 (does not threaten (3,4))

Since the position (3,4) is not threatened by any of the existing queens, we can safely place the fourth queen there. This completes the placement of all four queens on the board without any conflicts.

[at step#16: final answer]

The 4-queen problem with the given initial placements has been successfully solved. Here are the final positions of all four queens on a 4x4 chessboard:

- Queen 1: Row 1, Column 3
- Queen 2: Row 4, Column 2
- Queen 3: Row 2, Column 1
- Queen 4: Row 3, Column 4

These placements ensure that no two queens threaten each other either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Each queen is placed in a unique row and column, and their positions do not align along any major or minor diagonal that would allow them to attack one another. This configuration satisfies the conditions of the 4-queen puzzle.
