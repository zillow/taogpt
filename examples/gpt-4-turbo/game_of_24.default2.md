Solve this Game of 24: 7, 6, 2, 1.

Use every number exactly once.

**assistant:**

To solve the Game of 24 using the numbers 7, 6, 2, and 1, where each number must be used exactly once, you can follow these steps:

1. Multiply 7 by 2 to get 14.
2. Multiply 6 by 1 to get 6.
3. Add the results of step 1 and step 2 together: 14 + 6 = 20.
4. Multiply the result of step 3 by 2 to get 40.
5. Subtract 6 from the result of step 4 to get 24: 40 - 16 = 24.

Thus, the expression (7 * 2 + 6) * 2 - 6 = 24 solves the Game of 24 using the numbers 7, 6, 2, and 1.
