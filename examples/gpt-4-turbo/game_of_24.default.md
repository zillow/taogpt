Solve this Game of 24: 7, 6, 2, 1

**assistant:**

To solve the Game of 24 using the numbers 7, 6, 2, and 1, you need to find a way to use each number exactly once with any combination of the basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to make the total equal to 24. Here's one way to do it:

1. Multiply 7 by 6:
   \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \)

2. Subtract 2 from the result:
   \( 42 - 2 = 40 \)

3. Divide the result by 1 (which doesn't change the value):
   \( 40 \div 1 = 40 \)

4. Finally, subtract 6 from 40 to get 24:
   \( 40 - 16 = 24 \)

So, the operations are:
\[ (7 \times 6 - 2) \div 1 - 16 = 24 \]
