To provide you with a detailed route plan to Moscow, I would need to know your starting location. However, since I don't have access to the internet and cannot provide real-time or updated travel information, I'll give you a general outline of how to plan your trip to Moscow from a few different starting scenarios.

### From within Russia (Domestic Travel):
1. **By Air**: Book a flight to one of Moscow's international airports: Sheremetyevo (SVO), Domodedovo (DME), or Vnukovo (VKO).
2. **By Train**: Purchase a ticket for a long-distance train to one of Moscow's major railway stations such as Leningradsky, Kazansky, or Yaroslavsky.
3. **By Bus**: Find a bus service that runs to Moscow and book your ticket to one of the major bus stations in the city.
4. **By Car**: Plan your route using major highways that lead to Moscow. Ensure you have a map or GPS device with preloaded maps.

### From Europe (International Travel):
1. **By Air**: Book a direct flight to Moscow if available, or a connecting flight through a major European hub.
2. **By Train**: Consider taking an international train service to Moscow, such as those connecting through Belarus or the Baltic states.
3. **By Bus**: International bus services may be available from certain European cities to Moscow.
4. **By Car**: Plan your route through European countries, ensuring you meet visa and border crossing requirements. Major routes may include driving through the Baltics, Poland, Belarus, and into Russia.

### From Outside Europe:
1. **By Air**: Book an international flight to Moscow, which may include layovers depending on your departure point.
2. **By Sea and Train/Bus**: If you're starting from certain locations, you might travel by sea to a European port and then continue by train or bus to Moscow.

### General Tips:
- **Visa**: Ensure you have the necessary visa for Russia well in advance of your trip.
- **Travel Insurance**: Consider purchasing travel insurance for your journey.
- **Currency**: Have some Russian rubles (RUB) for expenses upon arrival.
- **Language**: Learn some basic Russian phrases or have a translation app ready, as English is not widely spoken outside tourist areas.
- **Connectivity**: Consider buying a local SIM card for mobile connectivity.
- **Accommodation**: Book your accommodation in advance, especially during peak tourist seasons or major events.

Remember to check the latest travel advisories and entry requirements for Russia before planning your trip.

Given your starting location in Urumqi, your preference to avoid flying, your desire to visit Lhasa on the way to Moscow, and your preference for comfort and minimal hassle, here is a suggested route plan:

### Urumqi to Lhasa:

1. **Train from Urumqi to Xining**: Take a long-distance train from Urumqi to Xining. This is a journey of approximately 24 hours. You can opt for a soft sleeper for more comfort.

2. **Train from Xining to Lhasa**: From Xining, you can board the Qinghai-Tibet Railway to Lhasa. This is a scenic route that will take you across the Tibetan Plateau. The journey takes about 21 hours, and again, a soft sleeper berth is recommended for comfort.

### Lhasa to Moscow:

Since you are avoiding flying, the journey from Lhasa to Moscow will be quite long and complex, involving several train changes. Here is a possible route:

1. **Train from Lhasa to Beijing**: Take the train back to Beijing from Lhasa. This will take approximately 40 hours, and you should book a soft sleeper for comfort.

2. **Train from Beijing to Ulaanbaatar**: From Beijing, you can take the Trans-Mongolian Railway to Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia. This leg of the journey will take about 30 hours.

3. **Train from Ulaanbaatar to Irkutsk**: After spending some time in Ulaanbaatar, board a train to Irkutsk in Russia. This journey can take around 24 hours.

4. **Train from Irkutsk to Moscow**: From Irkutsk, you will take the Trans-Siberian Railway to Moscow. This is a long journey, taking approximately 3-4 days, but it is one of the most famous train routes in the world. Opt for a first-class cabin for more comfort.

Please note that this route involves multiple days of train travel and will require you to obtain visas for China, Mongolia, and Russia. Additionally, you will need to plan for accommodations and transfers between train stations. It is highly recommended to book tickets in advance, especially for the sleeper classes, to ensure a comfortable journey. Always check the latest travel advisories and entry requirements for each country before planning your trip.

***HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN***



To create a detailed travel plan for a journey from Urumqi to Moscow with a preference for comfort and avoiding air travel, as well as incorporating a visit to Lhasa, we can devise a step-by-step plan. This plan will focus on identifying the sequence of train routes and any necessary stopovers, considering visa requirements and border crossings.

```json
{
  "1": {"description": "Identify the train route from Urumqi to Xining"},
  "2": {"description": "Plan the train travel from Xining to Lhasa"},
  "3": {"description": "Determine the optimal train route from Lhasa to Beijing"},

Tao has proposed the following different choices:

[Choice 1] Given your starting location in Urumqi, your preference to avoid flying, your desire to visit Lhasa on the way to Moscow, and your preference for comfort and minimal hassle, here is a suggested route plan:

***Urumqi to Lhasa***


1. **Train from Urumqi to Xining**: Take a long-distance train from Urumqi to Xining. This is a journey of approximately 24 hours. You can opt for a soft sleeper for more comfort.

2. **Train from Xining to Lhasa**: From Xining, you can board the Qinghai-Tibet Railway to Lhasa. This is a scenic route that will take you across the Tibetan Plateau. The journey takes about 21 hours, and again, a soft sleeper berth is recommended for comfort.

***Lhasa to Moscow***


Since you are avoiding flying, the journey from Lhasa to Moscow will be quite long and complex, involving several train changes. Here is a possible route:

1. **Train from Lhasa to Beijing**: Take the train back to Beijing from Lhasa. This will take approximately 40 hours, and you should book a soft sleeper for comfort.

2. **Train from Beijing to Ulaanbaatar**: From Beijing, you can take the Trans-Mongolian Railway to Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia. This leg of the journey will take about 30 hours.

3. **Train from Ulaanbaatar to Irkutsk**: After spending some time in Ulaanbaatar, board a train to Irkutsk in Russia. This journey can take around 24 hours.

4. **Train from Irkutsk to Moscow**: From Irkutsk, you will take the Trans-Siberian Railway to Moscow. This is a long journey, taking approximately 3-4 days, but it is one of the most famous train routes in the world. Opt for a first-class cabin for more comfort.

Please note that this route involves multiple days of train travel and will require you to obtain visas for China, Mongolia, and Russia. Additionally, you will need to plan for accommodations and transfers between train stations. It is highly recommended to book tickets in advance, especially for the sleeper classes, to ensure a comfortable journey. Always check the latest travel advisories and entry requirements for each country before planning your trip.

***MY_THOUGHT***


[at step#3: response to start working on the problem]

Given your starting location in Urumqi, your preference to avoid flying, your desire to visit Lhasa on the way to Moscow, and your preference for comfort and minimal hassle, here is a suggested route plan:

***Urumqi to Lhasa***


1. **Train from Urumqi to Xining**: Take a long-distance train from Urumqi to Xining. This is a journey of approximately 24 hours. You can opt for a soft sleeper for more comfort.

2. **Train from Xining to Lhasa**: From Xining, you can board the Qinghai-Tibet Railway to Lhasa. This is a scenic route that will take you across the Tibetan Plateau. The journey takes about 21 hours, and again, a soft sleeper berth is recommended for comfort.

***Lhasa to Moscow***


Since you are avoiding flying, the journey from Lhasa to Moscow will be quite long and complex, involving several train changes. Here is a possible route:

1. **Train from Lhasa to Beijing**: Take the train back to Beijing from Lhasa. This will take approximately 40 hours, and you should book a soft sleeper for comfort.

2. **Train from Beijing to Ulaanbaatar**: From Beijing, you can take the Trans-Mongolian Railway to Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia. This leg of the journey will take about 30 hours.

3. **Train from Ulaanbaatar to Irkutsk**: After spending some time in Ulaanbaatar, board a train to Irkutsk in Russia. This journey can take around 24 hours.

4. **Train from Irkutsk to Moscow**: From Irkutsk, you will take the Trans-Siberian Railway to Moscow. This is a long journey, taking approximately 3-4 days, but it is one of the most famous train routes in the world. Opt for a first-class cabin for more comfort.

Please note that this route involves multiple days of train travel and will require you to obtain visas for China, Mongolia, and Russia. Additionally, you will need to plan for accommodations and transfers between train stations. It is highly recommended to book tickets in advance, especially for the sleeper classes, to ensure a comfortable journey. Always check the latest travel advisories and entry requirements for each country before planning your trip.

[at step#5: revise response to fix issues]

I apologize for the oversight. Without access to the internet and specific train schedules, I can provide a more generalized route plan with the understanding that you will need to obtain the exact train numbers, departure times, and transfer details locally at the train stations or through a travel agency. Here is a revised, simplified route plan:

***Urumqi to Lhasa***


1. **Train from Urumqi to Xining**: Board a train from Urumqi to Xining. This leg of the journey will take about a day. Look for a train that offers soft sleeper compartments for comfort.

2. **Train from Xining to Lhasa**: From Xining, take the train to Lhasa on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. This journey will take roughly a day and offers breathtaking views of the Tibetan Plateau. Again, choose a soft sleeper for the best comfort.

***Lhasa to Moscow***


The journey from Lhasa to Moscow will involve multiple train changes and countries:

1. **Train from Lhasa to Beijing**: Take a train from Lhasa back to Beijing. This trip will take approximately two days. A soft sleeper compartment is recommended.

2. **Train from Beijing to Ulaanbaatar**: From Beijing, board the train to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. This journey will take about a day and a half.

3. **Train from Ulaanbaatar to Irkutsk**: After arriving in Ulaanbaatar, find a train to Irkutsk, Russia. This leg will take about a day.

4. **Train from Irkutsk to Moscow**: Finally, from Irkutsk, you will embark on the Trans-Siberian Railway to Moscow. This is the longest leg, taking approximately three to four days. A first-class cabin is suggested for maximum comfort.

Please ensure to check for the most recent train schedules and availability at local train stations or through a travel agency. You will also need to arrange visas for China, Mongolia, and Russia in advance, and consider accommodations for overnight stops or layovers. It's important to book your train tickets as early as possible, especially if you are looking for sleeper compartments, to ensure a comfortable journey.

[at step#3: response to start working on the problem]

I apologize for the oversight. Without access to the internet and specific train schedules, I can provide a more generalized route plan with the understanding that you will need to obtain the exact train numbers, departure times, and transfer details locally at the train stations or through a travel agency. Here is a revised, simplified route plan:

***Urumqi to Lhasa***


1. **Train from Urumqi to Xining**: Board a train from Urumqi to Xining. This leg of the journey will take about a day. Look for a train that offers soft sleeper compartments for comfort.

2. **Train from Xining to Lhasa**: From Xining, take the train to Lhasa on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. This journey will take roughly a day and offers breathtaking views of the Tibetan Plateau. Again, choose a soft sleeper for the best comfort.

***Lhasa to Moscow***


The journey from Lhasa to Moscow will involve multiple train changes and countries:

1. **Train from Lhasa to Beijing**: Take a train from Lhasa back to Beijing. This trip will take approximately two days. A soft sleeper compartment is recommended.

2. **Train from Beijing to Ulaanbaatar**: From Beijing, board the train to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. This journey will take about a day and a half.

3. **Train from Ulaanbaatar to Irkutsk**: After arriving in Ulaanbaatar, find a train to Irkutsk, Russia. This leg will take about a day.

4. **Train from Irkutsk to Moscow**: Finally, from Irkutsk, you will embark on the Trans-Siberian Railway to Moscow. This is the longest leg, taking approximately three to four days. A first-class cabin is suggested for maximum comfort.

Please ensure to check for the most recent train schedules and availability at local train stations or through a travel agency. You will also need to arrange visas for China, Mongolia, and Russia in advance, and consider accommodations for overnight stops or layovers. It's important to book your train tickets as early as possible, especially if you are looking for sleeper compartments, to ensure a comfortable journey.

[at step#4: Summarize final answer]

Given your starting location in Urumqi and your preference to avoid flying, as well as your desire for comfort and minimal hassle, here is a simplified route plan to travel to Moscow with a stop in Lhasa:

1. **Urumqi to Xining**: Begin your journey by taking a train from Urumqi to Xining. This leg of the journey will take approximately one day. For comfort, you should look for a train that offers soft sleeper compartments.

2. **Xining to Lhasa**: From Xining, you will take the train to Lhasa on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. This journey will also take roughly one day and offers scenic views of the Tibetan Plateau. Opt for a soft sleeper for comfort during this leg.

3. **Lhasa to Beijing**: After your visit in Lhasa, you will take a train back to Beijing. This trip will take about two days. A soft sleeper compartment is recommended for a comfortable journey.

4. **Beijing to Ulaanbaatar**: From Beijing, you will board a train to Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia. This journey will take approximately one and a half days.

5. **Ulaanbaatar to Irkutsk**: Once in Ulaanbaatar, you will find a train to Irkutsk, Russia. This leg will take about one day.

6. **Irkutsk to Moscow**: The final leg of your journey will be on the Trans-Siberian Railway from Irkutsk to Moscow. This is the longest part of the trip, taking approximately three to four days. For the best comfort, a first-class cabin is suggested.

Please note that this route plan is based on typical train routes and durations, and actual travel times may vary. You will need to obtain the exact train numbers, departure times, and transfer details locally at train stations or through a travel agency. Additionally, you will need to arrange visas for China, Mongolia, and Russia well in advance of your trip. It is also advisable to book your train tickets as early as possible, especially if you are looking for sleeper compartments, to ensure availability.

For accommodations during overnight stops or layovers, you may consider booking hotels near the train stations for convenience. Since you do not have internet access, you can arrange these accommodations through a travel agency or by contacting hotels directly by phone.

Lastly, be sure to check travel advisories and entry requirements for each country you will be visiting. This can be done by contacting the embassies or consulates of China, Mongolia, and Russia in your area or by seeking information from a travel agency.

This route plan aims to balance your preferences for comfort and minimal hassle with the constraints of overland travel to Moscow. Safe travels on your journey!

I apologize for the oversight. Without access to the internet and specific train schedules, I can provide a more generalized route plan with the understanding that you will need to obtain the exact train numbers, departure times, and transfer details locally at the train stations or through a travel agency. Here is a revised, simplified route plan:

***Urumqi to Lhasa***


1. **Train from Urumqi to Xining**: Board a train from Urumqi to Xining. This leg of the journey will take about a day. Look for a train that offers soft sleeper compartments for comfort.

2. **Train from Xining to Lhasa**: From Xining, take the train to Lhasa on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. This journey will take roughly a day and offers breathtaking views of the Tibetan Plateau. Again, choose a soft sleeper for the best comfort.

***Lhasa to Moscow***


The journey from Lhasa to Moscow will involve multiple train changes and countries:

1. **Train from Lhasa to Beijing**: Take a train from Lhasa back to Beijing. This trip will take approximately two days. A soft sleeper compartment is recommended.

2. **Train from Beijing to Ulaanbaatar**: From Beijing, board the train to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. This journey will take about a day and a half.

3. **Train from Ulaanbaatar to Irkutsk**: After arriving in Ulaanbaatar, find a train to Irkutsk, Russia. This leg will take about a day.

4. **Train from Irkutsk to Moscow**: Finally, from Irkutsk, you will embark on the Trans-Siberian Railway to Moscow. This is the longest leg, taking approximately three to four days. A first-class cabin is suggested for maximum comfort.

Please ensure to check for the most recent train schedules and availability at local train stations or through a travel agency. You will also need to arrange visas for China, Mongolia, and Russia in advance, and consider accommodations for overnight stops or layovers. It's important to book your train tickets as early as possible, especially if you are looking for sleeper compartments, to ensure a comfortable journey.

Based on your starting location in Urumqi and your preference to avoid flying, as well as your desire to visit Lhasa and preference for comfort and minimal hassle, here is a detailed route plan for your journey to Moscow:

**Urumqi to Lhasa:**
1. **Urumqi to Xining**: Begin your journey by taking a train from Urumqi to Xining. This leg of the journey will take approximately one day. Since you prefer comfort, it is recommended to book a soft sleeper compartment for this trip. You will need to check the local train station or contact a travel agency for the exact train options and schedules.

2. **Xining to Lhasa**: From Xining, you will transfer to the train bound for Lhasa on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. This journey will also take roughly one day.

**Additional Considerations:**
- **Visas**: You will need to secure visas for China, Mongolia, and Russia well in advance of your trip. This process can be complex and time-consuming, so it's important to start early. Contact the respective embassies or consulates for guidance on the application process.

- **Train Tickets**: Without internet access, you will need to purchase your train tickets directly at the train stations or through a travel agency. It's crucial to book these as early as possible, especially if you are looking for sleeper compartments, which are in high demand.

- **Accommodations**: For overnight stops or layovers, you may want to book hotels near the train stations for convenience. Since you do not have internet access, you can arrange your accommodations through a travel agency or by contacting hotels directly via phone.

- **Travel Advisories and Entry Requirements**: Check for any travel advisories and entry requirements for each country you will be visiting. This information can be obtained from embassies, consulates, or travel agencies.

- **Local Assistance**: Since you do not have internet access, it is advisable to seek assistance from local travel agencies or train station information desks throughout your journey. They can provide up-to-date schedules, ticket availability, and help with accommodations.

Please ensure that you have all the necessary documentation, including passports and visas, and that you are aware of the local COVID-19 regulations and travel restrictions that may be in place during your journey. Safe travels!
