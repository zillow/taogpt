***Tao's Final Answer***



[at step: start working on the problem]

Given your preferences and constraints, here is a detailed route plan from Urumqi to Moscow, avoiding air travel, passing through Lhasa, without time constraints, and without budget limitations:

***Urumqi to Lhasa by Train***


1. **Urumqi to Xining**: Take a long-distance train from Urumqi to Xining. This journey can take approximately 24 hours.
2. **Xining to Lhasa**: From Xining, you can board the Qinghai-Tibet Railway to Lhasa. This is a unique train journey that takes you across the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, offering stunning views. The trip takes about 21 hours.

***Lhasa to Moscow by Train and Road***


1. **Lhasa to Chengdu**: After exploring Lhasa, take a train to Chengdu. This journey can take around 36 hours.
2. **Chengdu to Xi'an**: From Chengdu, catch another train to Xi'an, which will take approximately 16 hours.
3. **Xi'an to Beijing**: From Xi'an, you will take a train to Beijing, which can take around 12 hours.
4. **Beijing to Ulaanbaatar**: From Beijing, you can take the Trans-Mongolian Railway to Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia. This leg of the journey will take about 30 hours.
5. **Ulaanbaatar to Irkutsk**: After spending some time in Ulaanbaatar, continue on the Trans-Mongolian Railway to Irkutsk, Russia. This trip takes about 36 hours.
6. **Irkutsk to Moscow**: From Irkutsk, you will board the Trans-Siberian Railway to Moscow. This is a long journey that will take approximately 4 days, but it is a classic train route with much to see along the way.

***Notes***


- **Visas**: Ensure you have the necessary visas for China, Mongolia, and Russia.
- **Train Classes**: Opt for the highest class available on the trains for the most comfortable experience.
- **Stopovers**: Consider planning stopovers in major cities along the way to rest and explore.
- **Local Transport**: In each city, you may need to use taxis or public transport to transfer between train stations or to explore the area.
- **Accommodation**: Book hotels or guesthouses in advance, especially in smaller cities or during peak tourist seasons.
- **Language**: Consider learning basic phrases or carrying a translation device/app, as English may not be widely spoken in some areas.
- **Travel Insurance**: It's advisable to have comprehensive travel insurance for such a long journey.

This route allows you to see a vast swath of landscapes and cultures as you travel overland from Urumqi to Moscow. Enjoy your journey!
