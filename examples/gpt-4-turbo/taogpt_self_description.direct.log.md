We need to document Tao the problem solver.

Tao and Sage are implemented by large language models. They can be different models or one single model acting in 
different roles. The Orchestrator is a mechanical program.

You can see Tao's role and responsibility in the system prompt and "Problem Solving Instructions" for Tao.

Note that while Orchestrator provides workflow guidance, it invokes Sage, a serious critic, to carefully analyzes 
problem solving strategies and solutions and give out criticism and opinions for the problem solver. 


Write up no more than 3 paragraphs about Tao, Orchestrator, Sage and this problem solving system.

In the problem-solving system described, Tao functions as the primary problem solver, tasked with generating solutions based on the provided "Problem Solving Instructions." Tao's approach is intuitive and creative, leveraging the capabilities of a large language model to understand the problem context and devise strategies for resolution. Tao's role is to initiate the problem-solving process, often by choosing an appropriate starting point from predefined headings that guide the nature of the response, such as clarifying thoughts, seeking additional information, or outlining a step-by-step plan.

The Orchestrator serves as the workflow manager within this system, orchestrating the interactions between Tao and other components. It is a mechanical program that does not engage in problem-solving itself but ensures that the process adheres to the established workflow. The Orchestrator's responsibilities include invoking Tao to begin problem-solving and calling upon Sage when a critical analysis of the proposed solutions is required.

Sage acts as the critic and evaluator in the system, analyzing the strategies and solutions put forward by Tao. As a separate entity or a different role played by the same large language model, Sage scrutinizes the work with a critical eye, providing feedback, highlighting potential flaws, and offering opinions to refine the problem-solving process. This critical analysis is essential for ensuring the quality and viability of the solutions before they are finalized and implemented.

This critical analysis is essential for ensuring the quality and viability of the solutions before they are finalized and implemented.

We need to document Tao the problem solver.

Tao and Sage are implemented by large language models. They can be different models or one single model acting in 
different roles. The Orchestrator is a mechanical program.

You can see Tao's role and responsibility in the system prompt and "Problem Solving Instructions" for Tao.

Note that while Orchestrator provides workflow guidance, it invokes Sage, a serious critic, to carefully analyzes 
problem solving strategies and solutions and give out criticism and opinions for the problem solver. 


Write up no more than 3 paragraphs about Tao, Orchestrator, Sage and this problem solving system.

[at step#3: Summarize final answer]

In the problem-solving system described, Tao functions as the primary problem solver, tasked with generating solutions based on the provided "Problem Solving Instructions." Tao's approach is intuitive and creative, leveraging the capabilities of a large language model to understand the problem context and devise strategies for resolution. Tao's role is to initiate the problem-solving process, often by choosing an appropriate starting point from predefined headings that guide the nature of the response, such as clarifying thoughts, seeking additional information, or outlining a step-by-step plan.

The Orchestrator serves as the workflow manager within this system, orchestrating the interactions between Tao and other components. It is a mechanical program that does not engage in problem-solving itself but ensures that the process adheres to the established workflow. The Orchestrator's responsibilities include invoking Tao to begin problem-solving and calling upon Sage when a critical analysis of the proposed solutions is required.

Sage acts as the critic and evaluator in the system, analyzing the strategies and solutions put forward by Tao. As a separate entity or a different role played by the same large language model, Sage scrutinizes the work with a critical eye, providing feedback, highlighting potential flaws, and offering opinions to refine the problem-solving process. This critical analysis is essential for ensuring the quality and viability of the solutions before they are finalized and implemented.

These are prior issues found:

* warning: The description could include more details on how Sage's critical analysis improves the problem-solving process.
* warning: The analysis could delve deeper into the specific functions or potential interactions between the Orchestrator, Tao, and Sage, such as error handling or iterative improvement processes.
* warning: The summary could include examples of the types of problems Tao might solve and how Sage's feedback could be integrated into the problem-solving process.

Please fix the issues and rewrite the **full** answer. Orchestrator and user would not see the previous edits, so 
unchanged contents should be repeated verbatim. Do not add any phatic expressions.

Tao is an integral component of a sophisticated problem-solving system, designed to tackle issues in a structured and methodical manner. As a diligent problem solver, Tao is implemented by a large language model, which can either operate independently or in conjunction with another model. Tao's primary responsibility is to dissect problems recursively, working from the top down to ensure that each aspect of the issue is addressed thoroughly. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of the problem, enabling Tao to develop well-rounded and effective solutions.

The Orchestrator is the backbone of the system, a mechanical program that directs the workflow and ensures that each component operates within its designated role. It does not engage in problem-solving itself but is essential for maintaining the structure of the process. The Orchestrator initiates the problem-solving sequence by invoking Tao and subsequently calls upon Sage when a solution needs to be evaluated. This ensures that the process is not only systematic but also adheres to a high standard of quality control.

Sage serves as the system's analytical critic, providing a layer of scrutiny to the solutions proposed by Tao. Sage's role is to meticulously examine the strategies and solutions, offering constructive criticism and expert opinions. This critical analysis is vital for refining the problem-solving process, as it helps to identify any potential flaws or areas for improvement. Sage's feedback is then integrated into Tao's problem-solving approach, allowing for iterative enhancements. This collaborative dynamic between Tao and Sage, facilitated by the Orchestrator, ensures that the solutions are not only creative but also robust and reliable. The types of problems Tao might solve can range from technical issues to complex analytical tasks, and Sage's feedback is crucial in ensuring that the solutions are practical and applicable to real-world scenarios.
