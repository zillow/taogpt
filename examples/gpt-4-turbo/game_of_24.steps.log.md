The Game of 24 is a mathematical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. This manipulation involves using any of the four basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). Each of the four numbers must be used exactly once.

[at step#4: Confirm the rules of the Game of 24, including allowed operations and constraints on number usage.]

The Game of 24 is a mathematical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. This manipulation involves using any of the four basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). Each of the four numbers must be used exactly once.

To solve the Game of 24 with the numbers 7, 6, 2, 1, I will explore various combinations and operations:

1. **Combination 1**: \(7 \times (6 - 2 \div 1)\)
   - Calculation: \(7 \times (6 - 2)\) = \(7 \times 4\) = 28 (Not 24)

2. **Combination 2**: \((7 - 1) \times (6 - 2)\)
   - Calculation: \(6 \times 4\) = 24 (Success)

3. **Combination 3**: \(6 \div (2 - (7 - 1))\)
   - Calculation: \(6 \div (2 - 6)\) = \(6 \div -4\) (Not 24)

4. **Combination 4**: \((6 \times 2 \times 2) - 1\)
   - Calculation: \(24 - 1\) = 23 (Not 24)

From the combinations explored, Combination 2 successfully reaches the target number 24 using each number exactly once. The operations used are subtraction and multiplication.
