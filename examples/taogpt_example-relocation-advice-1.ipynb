    "\n",
    "**1. San Francisco:** The city itself is a popular choice for many, particularly those who enjoy city life. There's a diverse range of neighborhoods such as the busy and trend-setting SoMa, the upscale and sunny Marina District, or artsy and bohemian Haight-Ashbury.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Silicon Valley (Palo Alto, Mountain View, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, etc.):** These areas are close to many tech company headquarters, making them a convenient choice if you work in that industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. East Bay (Oakland, Berkeley):** These cities have a cultural vibe all their own, with a vibrant arts scene, great restaurants, and beautiful parks and natural spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. North Bay (Marin County, Sausalito, Napa Valley):** These areas offer more laid-back and rural living, with beautiful scenery, close proximity to wine country, and in some areas, highly-rated schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Peninsula (San Mateo, Redwood City, Foster City):** Known for a higher quality of life, with less crowded neighborhoods, larger homes, and excellent schools.\n",
    "\n",

    "Say, for example, you're interested in a 2-bedroom apartment. You can look up the average rental prices for 2-bedroom apartments in each area to compare. However, this will also depend on other factors like commuting distances, food and lifestyle expenses, etc."
