Solve this 4x4 Sudoku represented by the 2-D Python array where 0 is the empty cell:

```python
[
    [0, 3, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 3],
    [2, 0, 3, 4],
    [3, 4, 0, 2],
]
```

Solve it in your head, do not write codes.

Problem Analysis

The problem is a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle. The rules of Sudoku are that each row, each column, and each of the nine 2x2 sub-grids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", "regions", or "sub-squares") contains all of the digits from 1 to 4. 

Looking at the given 2-D Python array, it seems to follow the rules of Sudoku. There are no repeated numbers in any row, column, or 2x2 sub-grid. The zeros represent empty cells that need to be filled in.

However, there is a contradiction in the problem statement. In the third row, the number 3 is repeated in the same 2x2 sub-grid. This violates the rules of Sudoku and makes the puzzle unsolvable as it currently stands. 

If we ignore this contradiction and attempt to solve the puzzle, we would find that it is impossible to complete without violating the rules of Sudoku. Therefore, the problem is not solvable in its current form. 

In conclusion, the problem statement contains a contradiction that makes the problem unsolvable. The Sudoku puzzle provided does not follow the rules of Sudoku and cannot be completed without violating these rules.

I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY

The solution to the Sudoku puzzle is:

```python
[
    [4, 3, 2, 1],
    [1, 2, 4, 3],
    [2, 1, 3, 4],
    [3, 4, 1, 2],
]
```

Here's how I solved it:

1. In the first row, the missing numbers are 2 and 4. The 2 can't go in the third position because there's already a 2 in that column, so the 2 must go in the fourth position and the 4 must go in the first position.

2. In the second row, the missing numbers are 2 and 4. The 4 can't go in the third position because there's already a 4 in that column, so the 4 must go in the second position and the 2 must go in the third position.

3. In the third row, the missing number is 1, which must go in the second position.

4. In the fourth row, the missing number is 1, which must go in the third position.

Tao's Final Answer

The solution to the Sudoku puzzle is:

```python
[
    [4, 3, 2, 1],
