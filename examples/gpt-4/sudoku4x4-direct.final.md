Solve this 4x4 Sudoku represented by the 2-D Python array where 0 is the empty cell:

```python
[
    [0, 3, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 3],
    [2, 0, 3, 4],
    [3, 4, 0, 2],
]
```
Solve it in your head, do not write codes.

***Problem Analysis***



The problem statement is clear and there are no fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions in the problem statement. The task is to solve a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle. Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 4x4 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the four 2x2 boxes contains all of the digits from 1 to 4. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution. 

In this case, the provided Sudoku puzzle is a 4x4 grid with some numbers already filled in. The task is to fill in the remaining numbers according to the rules of Sudoku. 

The only potential issue could be if the provided Sudoku puzzle does not have a valid solution, but that can only be determined by attempting to solve the puzzle.

***Tao's Final Answer***



The solved 4x4 Sudoku should look like:

```python
[
    [4, 3, 2, 1],
    [1, 2, 4, 3],
    [2, 1, 3, 4],
    [3, 4, 1, 2],
]
```

Explanation: 
In the first row, the missing numbers are 2 and 4. The 2 cannot be in the third column because there is already a 2 in the third column of the third row. So, 4 must be in the third column and 2 must be in the first column.

In the second row, the missing numbers are 2 and 4. Now that we know that the first column of the first row must be 2, the first column of the second row must be 1. So, 2 must be in the second column and 4 must be in the third column.

In the third row, the missing number is 1, which must be in the second column because there is already a 1 in the second column of the fourth row.

In the fourth row, the missing number is 1, which must be in the third column because we've already figured out the rest of the numbers in the row.

This solution respects the Sudoku rules: each row, each column, and each 2x2 subgrid contains all of the digits from 1 to 4 exactly once.
