Here is a high-level UI design description for the described task processing Web UI application.

## Layout:

1. **Task input section**: An expansible text input box for the user to input tasks in markdown text.
2. **Settings**: A collapsible settings form hidden by default. It's revealed when a "Settings" button is clicked. It will be a form with fields corresponding to the command-line tool options, each field with a clear label, an appropriate input (e.g., numerical input for numbers, checkboxes for booleans), and a help text describing what changing the setting does.
3. **Submit button**: A button to submit the task.
4. **Log navigation buttons**: Once the task is submitted, `first`, `previous`, `next`, `last` buttons appear.
5. **Output section**: Upon request via log navigation, relevant task logs are displayed here.
6. **State section**: A constant display of the current state of the task. If the state is "done", a button to get the final solution log appears here.

## Interactions:

1. The user inputs a task description in markdown into the task input section.
2. (Optional) The user clicks the "Settings" button to reveal the settings form & adjusts settings as needed.
3. The user clicks the "Submit" button to start the task processing.
4. The UI polls the server on a regular basis for the current task's state, which is updated live in the state section.
5. After submission, task log navigation buttons become active. The user can click "first", "previous", "next", and "last" to browse through the task logs. Retrieved logs are displayed in the output section.
6. When the status is "done", the user can click a newly appearing button to retrieve the final solution log.

## Styling:

The website's styling will reflect the philosophy of the Tao Te Ching, incorporating a balance of minimalistic simplicity and interactive dynamism to create a monitored and pleasant user experience.

1. **Color Theme**: Predominantly in shades of green, white, and brown for a calming, natural feel, with bold blue accents for interactive components. The colors are chosen to reflect the serenity and wisdom often associated with the Tao Te Ching.
2. **Typography**: Serif fonts with calming line geometry for text, Sans Serif fonts for buttons and labels for a more technical feel. The fonts will be easy to read.
3. **Animations**: Smooth transitions and animations for expanding/collapsing settings, loading data, and switching logs. Nothing too flashy, just enough to make the application feel responsive and alive.
4. **Buttons**: Textual buttons coupled with descriptive icons. The buttons will have a slightly 3D effect to signify interactiveness.
5. **Whitespace**: Adequate whitespace would be used to separate different sections, making it easier for the user to focus on one task at a time.

Remember this is a high-level design. For a more detailed design specification, professional design software like Adobe XD or Sketch can be used to create wireframes & interactive prototypes.
