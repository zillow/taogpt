```



The already implemented program skeleton looks like:



```python

# package taogpt



argparser = argparse.Parser(...) # argument parser for the above command-line args



@dataclass

class TaskState:

    status: str # one of "running", "pause", "cancelled", "done"

    step: int # the last completed step number. 0-based

    pending_questions: Optional[List[str]] # for "pause", a list of questions



class Task(Thread):

    def __init__(self, args):

        # ... init the task ...



    @property

    def task_key(self) -> str:

        # a random identifier representing the task. It is unique across the system.



    def start(self, args):

        # ... working on the task in background

        # ... once a while after a step, write information about the progress in a markdown-formatted log file ..

        # ... it pay pause to ask the user some questions ... 



    def current_status_and_questions() -> TaskState:

        # return the current task state

        

    def cancel():

        # cancel the task, set its status to 'cancelled'

        

    def resume(answers: List[str]):

        # provide the list of answer corresponding to the pending questions

        # and the resume execution

        

    def retrieve_log(self, step_num: int) -> Optional[str]:

        # get the markdown log for the step; if step_num is beyond the last completed step, return None

```



An example command-line tool processing one task looks like:



```python

import taogpt

TASK_REGISTRY = dict()



args = taogpt.arparser.parse(args) # see command-line options above

task = taogpt.Task(args)

TASK_REGISTRY[task.task_key] = task

task.start()



while True:

    state = task.current_state()

    print(task.retrieve_log(state.step)) # print the last step's info

    

    if state.status in ('done', 'cancel'):

        task.join() # wait for task thread completion

        print(state.status, "see result from the last step") # tell the user the we are finished

        break

    if state.status == 'pause':

        answers = [input(question) in question in state.pending_questions]

        if 'cancel' in answers:

            task.cancel() # request cancellation

            continue

        else:

            task.resume(answers)

```



I want to a UI design of Web UI application that:



1. Let user to input a task description in markdown text.

2. Let user change settings. (The setting form should be hidden until the user click a button.)

3. After the user submit the task, poll the server for current state of the task.

4. Allow the user to browse through the detail logs using buttons `first`, `previous`, `next`, `last`. (Progress log

   is shown upon user request rather than printing out automatically as in the command-line tool.)

5. If the state is done, allow the user to get the final solution log.

6. UI design: The application should be highly interactive, easy, and pleasant to use. Color theme should reflect

   the philosophy of the Tao Te Ching. Use text buttons is OK.



Do not implement any of these yet, not even the HTML or CSS. I just want to a high-level description of UI design:

the layout, how user interacts with the program, the actual styling such as color theme.

***Problem Analysis***



The problem statement does not contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions. It is a clear and well-defined task of designing a user interface for a web application that interacts with a command-line tool. The requirements for the UI design are well laid out, including the need for user input, task submission, server polling, log browsing, and final solution retrieval. The additional requirement for the UI design to reflect the philosophy of the Tao Te Ching adds a creative aspect to the task. 

The problem is solvable. The task involves designing a user interface that allows users to interact with a command-line tool via a web application. This is a common practice in software development, where command-line tools are often wrapped in more user-friendly interfaces to make them accessible to a wider range of users. 

The task does not require the actual implementation of the UI, only a high-level description of the design. This includes the layout, user interaction, and styling. These are standard elements of UI design and there are many established methods and principles that can be applied to this task. 

In conclusion, the problem is well-defined and solvable. The next step would be to start designing the UI based on the requirements provided in the problem statement.

[at step: Understand and visualize the user's journey while using the application]

The user's journey while using the application can be visualized as follows:

1. **Task Input**: The user starts by inputting a task description in markdown text. This is the primary interaction the user has with the application. The user is expected to provide a detailed and clear description of the task they want to solve.

2. **Settings Configuration**: The user has the option to change settings. This is hidden by default and can be accessed by clicking a button. The settings allow the user to customize the behavior of the application according to their preferences.

3. **Task Submission**: After inputting the task and configuring the settings, the user submits the task. The application then starts processing the task in the background.

4. **Server Polling**: The application periodically polls the server for the current state of the task. This allows the user to monitor the progress of the task.

5. **Log Browsing**: The user can browse through the detail logs using buttons `first`, `previous`, `next`, `last`. This allows the user to review the steps taken by the application to solve the task.

6. **Final Solution Retrieval**: Once the task is done, the user can retrieve the final solution log. This provides the user with the final output of the task.

Throughout this journey, the user interacts with the application through various inputs and actions. The application provides feedback and updates to the user through its interface.

[at step: Design the interface layout]

The user interface will be divided into three main sections:

1. **Task Input and Settings Configuration**: This will be on the left side of the screen and will include two sub-sections:
    * **Task Input**: A large, resizable text box for the user to enter the task description in markdown text. Above the text box, there will be a label indicating that the user should enter the task description.
    * **Settings Configuration**: Below the task input box, there will be a button labeled "Settings". When clicked, it will toggle the visibility of a form with input fields for each of the settings mentioned in the problem statement. Each input field will be labeled with the corresponding setting name and will include a tooltip with a brief explanation of what the setting controls. The form will have a submit button at the bottom. 

2. **Task Status and Control**: This will be at the top of the screen and will include the following elements:
    * **Task Status**: A display showing the current status of the task. This will be updated periodically as the server is polled for the current state of the task.
    * **Control Buttons**: Three buttons labeled "Submit", "Cancel", and "Retrieve Solution". The "Submit" button will start the task, the "Cancel" button will cancel the current task, and the "Retrieve Solution" button will retrieve the final solution log when the task is done. 

3. **Log Browser**: This will occupy the right side of the screen and will include a text box displaying the current log entry and four buttons labeled "First", "Previous", "Next", and "Last" for navigating through the log entries.

[at step: Detail how user interacts with the application]

The user interacts with the application in the following ways:

1. **Task Input and Settings Configuration**: The user can type a task description in the task input box. If they want to change the settings, they can click the "Settings" button to reveal the settings form, where they can input their preferred values and then click the "Submit" button to apply the changes.

2. **Task Submission**: When the user is ready to submit the task, they can click the "Submit" button in the task status and control section. If they want to cancel the task, they can click the "Cancel" button. If the task has finished and they want to retrieve the final solution log, they can click the "Retrieve Solution" button.

3. **Server Polling**: The application automatically polls the server for the current task state. The user can see the status of the task in real-time in the task status display.

4. **Log Browsing**: The user can view the progress log in the log browser section. They can navigate through the log entries by clicking the "First", "Previous", "Next", and "Last" buttons. The current log entry is displayed in the text box in this section.

Throughout this process, the user receives visual feedback from the application. For instance, the task status display updates as the task progresses, and the log browser displays the current log entry.

[at step: Choose the color theme and styling that reflect the Tao Te Ching philosophy]

The Tao Te Ching philosophy is characterized by harmony, balance, simplicity, and naturalness. It emphasizes the concept of Yin and Yang – the idea of dual forces existing in harmony and balance. Therefore, the color theme should reflect these principles.

We can use a color theme of deep blues and whites. The deep blue represents the mysterious Tao, the absolute principle underlying the universe, combining within itself the principles of yin and yang. The white represents purity and simplicity, in alignment with the Taoist principle of living a simple and honest life.

The layout should be clean and minimalist, adhering to the Taoist principle of simplicity. The buttons and input fields can be styled with soft edges to give a sense of harmony and balance. Typography should also be simple and clear, ensuring that the user interface is easy to understand and use.

In terms of interactivity, transitions between different states of the application should be smooth and natural, reflecting the Taoist idea of flowing with the nature. For example, when the user clicks on the "Settings" button, the settings form can slide down smoothly instead of appearing abruptly. Similarly, when navigating through the log entries, the current log entry can fade out and the next one can fade in, providing a seamless user experience.

Overall, the design of the user interface should embody the Taoist philosophy by being simple, harmonious, balanced, and natural.

[at step: 5: Review the overall design and make necessary revisions]

The overall design as described in the previous steps seems to meet all the requirements stated in the problem statement. It provides all the necessary functionality for the user to interact with the command-line tool via a web application, and it does so in a way that is intuitive and user-friendly. The color theme and styling reflect the philosophy of the Tao Te Ching, adding a unique aesthetic element to the design.

However, there are a few potential areas for improvement or further consideration:

1. **User Feedback**: The application provides visual feedback to the user through the task status display and the log browser. However, there may be opportunities to enhance this feedback. For instance, the application could display a loading spinner or progress bar while the task is processing, to give the user a clearer sense of what's happening behind the scenes.

2. **Error Handling**: The design does not currently specify how the application should handle errors. For example, what happens if the user inputs an invalid task description or setting value, or if there's a server error during the task processing? The design could be improved by specifying how these situations should be handled and communicated to the user.

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: The design does not specify whether the application should be responsive to different screen sizes. If the application is expected to be used on mobile devices as well as desktop computers, the design should take this into account.

4. **Accessibility**: The design should consider accessibility best practices to ensure that the application is usable by as wide a range of users as possible. For example, the color contrast should be sufficient for users with visual impairments, and all functionality should be accessible via keyboard for users who cannot use a mouse.

In conclusion, while the overall design is solid, these potential areas for improvement should be considered in the final design revision.

***Tao's Final Answer***



[at step: summarize final answer]

The high-level description of the UI design for the web application is as follows:

The application's user interface is divided into three main sections:

1. **Task Input and Settings Configuration**: Located on the left side of the screen, this section allows users to input a task description in markdown text and configure application settings. The task input is a large, resizable text box, and the settings configuration is a form that is hidden by default and revealed when the user clicks a "Settings" button.

2. **Task Status and Control**: Located at the top of the screen, this section displays the current status of the task and provides control buttons for the user to submit a task, cancel a task, and retrieve the final solution log.

3. **Log Browser**: Located on the right side of the screen, this section allows users to browse through detail logs. It displays the current log entry in a text box and provides navigation buttons labeled "First", "Previous", "Next", and "Last".

The UI design reflects the philosophy of the Tao Te Ching through its color theme and styling. The color theme consists of deep blues and whites, symbolizing the Taoist principles of mystery, purity, and simplicity. The layout is clean and minimalist, with soft-edged buttons and input fields for a sense of harmony and balance.

User interactions with the application are straightforward and intuitive. Users can easily input a task description, configure settings, submit tasks, and navigate through logs. Visual feedback is provided through the task status display and the log browser.

The design also considers potential areas for improvement, such as enhanced user feedback, error handling, mobile responsiveness, and accessibility. These considerations ensure the application is user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of users.

This is the final step.
