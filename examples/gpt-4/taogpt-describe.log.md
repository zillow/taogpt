***Problem Solving Instructions***



Given problem solving session so far, choose one of the following strategies:

## Strategy: Give up on errors

If you see any errors or inconsistencies, response with the list of **specific** issues in valid JSON like this:

 `````markdown
 # BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR

```json
[
  "<issue 1 with details>",
  "<issue 2 with details>",
  // ...
]
```
`````

Do NOT try to fix the errors since Orchestrator wouldn't understand. Instead it will let you try other alternatives 
later.

## Strategy: Ask Questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Use this strategy to ask questions, but avoid obvious, trivial, 
redundant, or useless questions. You should try to ask all questions you need up front. You must follow the
following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the questions to the user.

```markdown
# I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED
<optional introductory and analysis>

1. <question> [<explanation>]
2. <question> [<explanation>]
...
```

## Strategy: Step-by-step Plan

In this strategy, the problem task is turned into a top-down, high-level, step-by-step plan of which you and 
Orchestrator will solve using tree traversal and backtracking.

* Think abstract. Come up with generic, and high-level. Avoid detailed, specific, fixed-value, and low-level ones. 
  Because it is impossible to backtrack and try different values in detailed plans in case of errors. Likewise, 
  choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. For example, choose "Find and set missing elements to fill-in 
  values" instead of "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22".
* Avoid loops if possible as they are less friendly to depth-first search for solution.
* Worship Occam's razor.

Do NOT fill in any details and do NOT work on the plan yet, Orchestrator will prompt you to work at each step later.

Follow this markdown template:

`````markdown
# HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN

```json
{
  "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
  "2": {
        "description": "<high-level description without details>",
        "sub_steps": {
            "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
            "2": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"}
        }
       },
  // ...
}
```
`````

## Strategy: Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao 
solve problems. It's stateful and previously defined globals can be used without redefining. Be tidy, avoid useless 
code comments. **Pay attention to Python indentation rules!** Follow the example below to ask Genie:

`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE

```python
print("Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer!")
(23 + 11) / 5
```
`````

Note: if the problem step asks for writing codes as the answer, provide the codes using direct answer strategy.

## Strategy: Direct Answer

Only if task problem is simple and you know the correct answer to the whole problem, you 
can answer it directly. If you need to write out any file contents, write out the content in markdown fenced code 
block under its own file section.

Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

```markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content in markdown fenced code block>
```


Important notes:
* Respect the original task problem! Do NOT alter inadvertently.

***Project README: Problem Solving System***



This project incorporates a problem-solving system involving three key components: Tao, Orchestrator, and Sage. The interaction between these entities promotes an organized, recursive, and top-down approach to problem-solving, ensuring diligent and thorough resolution of issues.

## Tao

Tao is the diligent problem solver within the system. Tao's responsibility revolves around analyzing and solving problems in a systematic, top-down manner. Instead of jumping to conclusions, Tao breaks down the problems into manageable steps, working through each one at a time, ensuring a comprehensive understanding and solution to the problems.

## Orchestrator

The Orchestrator acts as a workflow guide in the system. It provides direction to Tao, ensuring that the problem-solving process stays on track and follows a logical, organized path. The Orchestrator invokes Sage when necessary, ensuring that the strategies and solutions proposed by Tao are thoroughly and critically evaluated.

## Sage

Sage is the critic within the system. It is responsible for the careful analysis of the problem-solving strategies and solutions proposed by Tao. Sage provides insightful criticism and opinions, working to ensure the validity and effectiveness of the proposed solutions. 

## Interaction and System Summary

The interaction between Tao, Orchestrator, and Sage forms the backbone of the problem-solving system. Tao proposes solutions, Orchestrator guides the workflow, and Sage provides critical evaluations, all working synergistically to create a recursive, thorough, and effective problem-solving process. This system values diligence, thoroughness, and critical thinking, ensuring that problems are not just solved, but understood and learned from.

### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT: None. This is the final step.

Based on proposed problem solving approaches, the state of execution, and the partial answers which can be seen in
the conversation thread, we want to determine if we are on the good track to solve the task problem and score 
the proposed approaches in the range of [0.0, 10.0], the higher the score the more preferable.

Scoring criteria: 
* If the original task problem contains error and not solvable or we are at a dead-end or infinite loop trying to 
  solve the original, then all approaches except `BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR` get 0 scores.
* Direct answers that are incorrect should get a score of 0.
* The approaches which lead to incorrect results should get a score of 0.
* The assumption implied/used should be correct.
* The questions asked by Tao should be relevant and not trivial.
* Among `HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN` strategies, choose simple, generic, and high-level over detailed, specific, 
  and low-level ones. Because it is impossible to backtrack and try different values in detailed plans in case of 
  errors. Likewise, choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. For example, choose "Find and set missing 
  elements to fill-in values" instead of "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22". Tao is good at handling details himself.
* Try to avoid identical scores (except 0's;) you can use decimal points (e.g. 9.5) to distinguish two different 
  approaches.
* Among similar approaches, mark others as duplicates of the best one; note: an approach can only duplicate another 
  approach if the two are of same kinds, e.g. two direct answers.

***I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY***



***Project README: Problem Solving System***



This project incorporates a problem-solving system involving three key components: Tao, Orchestrator, and Sage. The interaction between these entities promotes an organized, recursive, and top-down approach to problem-solving, ensuring diligent and thorough resolution of issues.

***Tao***


Tao is the diligent problem solver within the system. Tao's responsibility revolves around analyzing and solving problems in a systematic, top-down manner. Instead of jumping to conclusions, Tao breaks down the problems into manageable steps, working through each one at a time, ensuring a comprehensive understanding and solution to the problems.

***Orchestrator***


The Orchestrator acts as a workflow guide in the system. It provides direction to Tao, ensuring that the problem-solving process stays on track and follows a logical, organized path. The Orchestrator invokes Sage when necessary, ensuring that the strategies and solutions proposed by Tao are thoroughly and critically evaluated.

***Sage***


Sage is the critic within the system. It is responsible for the careful analysis of the problem-solving strategies and solutions proposed by Tao. Sage provides insightful criticism and opinions, working to ensure the validity and effectiveness of the proposed solutions.

***Interaction and System Summary***


The interaction between Tao, Orchestrator, and Sage forms the backbone of the problem-solving system. Tao proposes solutions, Orchestrator guides the workflow, and Sage provides critical evaluations, all working synergistically to create a recursive, thorough, and effective problem-solving process. This system values diligence, thoroughness, and critical thinking, ensuring that problems are not just solved, but understood and learned from.

***NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT:: None. This is the final step.***

***Problem Solving Instructions***



Given problem solving session so far, choose one of the following strategies:

## Strategy: Give up on errors

If you see any errors or inconsistencies, response with the list of **specific** issues in valid JSON like this:

 `````markdown
 # BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR

```json
[
  "<issue 1 with details>",
  "<issue 2 with details>",
  // ...
]
```
`````

Do NOT try to fix the errors since Orchestrator wouldn't understand. Instead it will let you try other alternatives 
later.

## Strategy: Ask Questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Use this strategy to ask questions, but avoid obvious, trivial, 
redundant, or useless questions. You should try to ask all questions you need up front. You must follow the
following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the questions to the user.

```markdown
# I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED
<optional introductory and analysis>

1. <question> [<explanation>]
2. <question> [<explanation>]
...
```

## Strategy: Step-by-step Plan

In this strategy, the problem task is turned into a top-down, high-level, step-by-step plan of which you and 
Orchestrator will solve using tree traversal and backtracking.

* Think abstract. Come up with generic, and high-level. Avoid detailed, specific, fixed-value, and low-level ones. 
  Because it is impossible to backtrack and try different values in detailed plans in case of errors. Likewise, 
  choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. For example, choose "Find and set missing elements to fill-in 
  values" instead of "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22".
* Avoid loops if possible as they are less friendly to depth-first search for solution.
* Worship Occam's razor.

Do NOT fill in any details and do NOT work on the plan yet, Orchestrator will prompt you to work at each step later.

Follow this markdown template:

`````markdown
# HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN

```json
{
  "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
  "2": {
        "description": "<high-level description without details>",
        "sub_steps": {
            "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
            "2": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"}
        }
       },
  // ...
}
```
`````

## Strategy: Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao 
solve problems. It's stateful and previously defined globals can be used without redefining. Be tidy, avoid useless 
code comments. **Pay attention to Python indentation rules!** Follow the example below to ask Genie:

`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE

```python
print("Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer!")
(23 + 11) / 5
```
`````

Note: if the problem step asks for writing codes as the answer, provide the codes using direct answer strategy.

## Strategy: Direct Answer

Go with this strategy if the step is simple and you know the correct answer. You should also tell the Orchestrator 
which step you want to work at next in the `NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section. If you need to write out any file
contents, write out the content in markdown fenced code block under its own file section.

Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

```markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content in markdown fenced code block>

### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT:
<next step ID: description> or "None. This is the final step."
```


Important notes:
* Respect the original task problem! Do NOT alter inadvertently.

Given problem solving session so far, choose one of the following strategies:

## Strategy: Give up on errors

If you see any errors or inconsistencies, response with the list of **specific** issues in valid JSON like this:

 `````markdown
 # BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR

```json
[
  "<issue 1 with details>",
  "<issue 2 with details>",

`````

Do NOT try to fix the errors since Orchestrator wouldn't understand. Instead it will let you try other alternatives 
later.

## Strategy: Ask Questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Use this strategy to ask questions, but avoid obvious, trivial, 
redundant, or useless questions. You should try to ask all questions you need up front. You must follow the
following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the questions to the user.

[at step: Describe the role and responsibilities of the Orchestrator]

The Orchestrator is the guiding force in this problem-solving system. Its primary role is to provide workflow guidance, ensuring that the problem-solving process is structured and systematic.

***Final Answer***



The problem-solving system is a collaborative platform designed to tackle complex problems in a structured and systematic manner. It leverages the unique strengths of three key components: Tao, Orchestrator, and Sage.

Tao is the diligent problem solver in this system. His primary role is to solve problems in a recursive, top-down fashion. He takes one step at a time, ensuring that each step is thoroughly analyzed and solved before moving on to the next. Tao's responsibilities include understanding the problem at hand, breaking it down into manageable steps, and working through each step methodically. He is also responsible for communicating his progress and findings to the Orchestrator and Sage, and for incorporating their feedback into his problem-solving process.

The Orchestrator is the guiding force in this problem-solving system. Its primary role is to provide workflow guidance, ensuring that the problem-solving process is structured and systematic. The Orchestrator's responsibilities include invoking Sage at appropriate times to analyze Tao's problem-solving strategies and solutions. It also manages the interaction between Tao and Sage, ensuring that their collaboration is effective and productive.

Sage is the critic in this problem-solving system. Its primary role is to carefully analyze the problem-solving strategies and solutions proposed by Tao. Sage provides criticism and opinions, helping to refine and improve the problem-solving process. Sage's responsibilities include scrutinizing Tao's problem-solving steps, identifying potential errors or inefficiencies, and providing constructive feedback.

The interaction between Tao, Orchestrator, and Sage is a crucial aspect of this problem-solving system. The Orchestrator manages the interaction between Tao and Sage, invoking Sage at appropriate times to analyze Tao's problem-solving strategies and solutions. Sage scrutinizes Tao's problem-solving steps and provides constructive feedback, which is communicated back to Tao through the Orchestrator, helping Tao to refine his problem-solving process.

This system is designed to facilitate effective problem-solving by breaking down complex problems into manageable steps, encouraging critical analysis, and promoting collaboration.

We need to document Tao the problem solver.

You can see Tao's role and responsibility in the system prompt and "Problem Solving Instructions" for Tao.

Note that while Orchestrator provides workflow guidance, it invokes Sage, a serious critic, to carefully analyzes 
problem solving strategies and solutions and give out criticism and opinions for the problem solver. 

Write up about Tao, Orchestrator, Sage and this problem solving system in a project README style.
