# GPT-4 default system prompt (2023/09/30)

**User**: I want to travel to Moscow. Find me a travel route. (Do not do any web search, I just need the route plan.)

**gpt-4**: Sure, without specific starting point details, here's a general guideline on planning your route to Moscow:

1. **Flight to Moscow**: The majority of international travelers reach Moscow by air. Sheremetyevo International Airport (SVO), Domodedovo International Airport (DME), and Vnukovo International Airport (VKO) are the three main airports in Moscow.

2. **Visa**: Make sure you have the necessary travel documentation. Most people will need a visa to enter Russia, which must be obtained in advance.

3. **Upon Arrival in Moscow**: Once you arrive at the airport, you have several options to reach the city center. You might take the Aeroexpress train, which is a non-stop train service; opt for the more budget-friendly buses, or use taxi services.

4. **Navigate through the city**: Moscow's city transport system is very effective. The metro system is the most common; it's comprehensive, efficient, and the fastest way to get around the city. You can also use taxis, buses, trams, or rent a car to navigate from one place to another.

Please note, the situation might change due to COVID-19, so always make sure to check travel advisories from official governmental websites before planning a trip.
