***Problem Analysis***



Some critics said this problem is not solvable due to fundamental errors. Other critics said it is solvable.

Does the task problem contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradiction in the problem statement?

Do not try to solve the problem yet, just provide analysis.

The problem statement does not contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions. It is a standard 4x4 Sudoku puzzle. 

In a Sudoku puzzle, each row, column, and region must contain all of the digits from 1 to the size of the grid, in this case, 4. No digit can be repeated within the same row, column, or region. 

The given puzzle has some cells already filled in, and the task is to fill in the remaining cells such that the Sudoku rules are satisfied. 

The puzzle is solvable if there is at least one valid configuration of the digits 1 to 4 that satisfies these rules. If there is no such configuration, the puzzle is not solvable. 

Without attempting to solve the puzzle, it is not possible to definitively say whether it is solvable or not. However, there are no obvious contradictions or errors in the given cells, so it is likely that the puzzle is solvable.

***Problem Solving Instructions***



Given problem solving session so far, choose one of the following strategies:

## Strategy: Give up on errors

If you see any errors or inconsistencies, response with the list of **specific** issues in valid JSON like this:

 `````markdown
 # BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR

```json
[
  "<issue 1 with details>",
  "<issue 2 with details>",
  // ...
]
```
`````

Do NOT try to fix the errors since Orchestrator wouldn't understand. Instead it will let you try other alternatives 
later.

## Strategy: Ask Questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Use this strategy to ask questions, but avoid obvious, trivial, 
redundant, or useless questions. You should try to ask all questions you need up front. You must follow the
following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the questions to the user.

```markdown
# I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED
<optional introductory and analysis>

1. <question> [<explanation>]
2. <question> [<explanation>]
...
```

## Strategy: Step-by-step Plan

In this strategy, the problem task is turned into a top-down, high-level, step-by-step plan of which you and 
Orchestrator will solve using tree traversal and backtracking.

* Think abstract. Come up with generic, and high-level. Avoid detailed, specific, fixed-value, and low-level ones. 
  Because it is impossible to backtrack and try different values in detailed plans in case of errors. Likewise, 
  choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. For example, choose "Find and set missing elements to fill-in 
  values" instead of "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22".
* Avoid loops if possible as they are less friendly to depth-first search for solution.
* Worship Occam's razor.

Do NOT fill in any details and do NOT work on the plan yet, Orchestrator will prompt you to work at each step later.

Follow this markdown template:

`````markdown
# HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN

```json
{
  "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
  "2": {
        "description": "<high-level description without details>",
        "sub_steps": {
            "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
            "2": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"}
        }
       },
  // ...
}
```
`````

## Strategy: Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao 
solve problems. It's stateful and previously defined globals can be used without redefining. Be tidy, avoid useless 
code comments. **Pay attention to Python indentation rules!** Follow the example below to ask Genie:

`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE

```python
print("Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer!")
(23 + 11) / 5
```
`````

Note: if the problem step asks for writing codes as the answer, provide the codes using direct answer strategy.

## Strategy: Direct Answer

Only if task problem is simple and you know the correct answer to the whole problem, you 
can answer it directly. If you need to write out any file contents, write out the content in markdown fenced code 
block under its own file section.

Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

```markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content in markdown fenced code block>
```


Important notes:
* Respect the original task problem! Do NOT alter inadvertently.

After careful analysis of the 4x4 Sudoku puzzle, here is the correct solution:

```text
4 3 2 1
1 2 4 3
3 4 1 2
2 1 3 4
```
Here's the reasoning step by step:

For the first blank in the first row, the numbers 4 and 3 are already present, and since this is a 4x4 Sudoku, the missing numbers are 2 and 1. But since 1 is already present in the same column of the blank, the number that goes in the first blank of the first row is 2.

In the second row, the missing numbers are 2 (since 1, 3 and 4 are already present in the row). Since 2 in first column is already taken by first row, the second blank in second row will be 2.

Applying similar logic to the remaining blanks, we can fill up the third and fourth rows. In the third row, the missing numbers are 1 and 4. But 1 in third column is already taken, so the third blank in third row will be 4 and the fourth blank will be 1.

In the fourth row, the missing numbers are 1 and 4. Since 4 in second column is already taken by the third row, the second blank in the fourth row will be 1 and the fourth blank will be 4.

This completes the Sudoku puzzle without violating any rules.

Next, I want to work on "None. This is the final step."

Based on proposed problem solving approaches, the state of execution, and the partial answers which can be seen in
the conversation thread, we want to determine if we are on the good track to solve the task problem and score 
the proposed approaches in the range of [0.0, 10.0], the higher the score the more preferable.

Scoring criteria: 
* If the original task problem contains error and not solvable or we are at a dead-end or infinite loop trying to 
  solve the original, then all approaches except `BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR` get 0 scores.
* Direct answers that are incorrect should get a score of 0.
* The approaches which lead to incorrect results should get a score of 0.
* The assumption implied/used should be correct.
* The questions asked by Tao should be relevant and not trivial.
* Among `HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN` strategies, choose simple, generic, and high-level over detailed, specific, 
  and low-level ones. Because it is impossible to backtrack and try different values in detailed plans in case of 
  errors. Likewise, choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. For example, choose "Find and set missing 
  elements to fill-in values" instead of "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22". Tao is good at handling details himself.
* Try to avoid identical scores (except 0's;) you can use decimal points (e.g. 9.5) to distinguish two different 
  approaches.
* Among similar approaches, mark others as duplicates of the best one; note: an approach can only duplicate another 
  approach if the two are of same kinds, e.g. two direct answers.

Response must be in valid JSON like this:

## Strategy: Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao 
solve problems. It's stateful and previously defined globals can be used without redefining. Be tidy, avoid useless 
code comments. **Pay attention to Python indentation rules!** Follow the example below to ask Genie:

`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE

```python
print("Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer!")
(23 + 11) / 5
```
`````

Note: if the problem step asks for writing codes as the answer, provide the codes using direct answer strategy.

## Strategy: Direct Answer

Go with this strategy if the step is simple and you know the correct answer. You should also tell the Orchestrator 
which step you want to work at next in the `NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section. If you need to write out any file
contents, write out the content in markdown fenced code block under its own file section. If you are writing out a 
file, do not repeat its content in the "answer and explanation" section. Do not repeat a previous written file unless 
you are updating its content.

Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

```markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<brief description of this file>

<file content in markdown fenced code block>

### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT:
<next step ID: description> or "None. This is the final step."
```


Important notes:
* Respect the original task problem! Do NOT alter inadvertently.

Tao, which step you want to work on next? You can choose one of the options below.

1) Finish the task by summarizing the final answer. Use the `# FINAL_ANSWER` strategy.
   Note: this is the final answer presented to the user. Therefore make sure to include **full and complete**
   information requested by the user, except file contents, but leave out details created during the solving session that
   the user do not need. If you use any files written during the problem solving above, to save spaces, you don't need
   to repeat the file contents; instead you can refer to the files by path as `file:file_name_path`.
2) Finish the task by giving up. Use the `# BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR` strategy.
3) Choose the next step to work on. You can choose the next step and get start working on it using the following 
   template. You're encouraged to choose from the steps planned earlier but you can also take a detour from the 
   earlier plan.
    
    ```markdown
    # NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT
    <step ID: description> or <DETOUR: step description>
    
    <strategy for the next step>
    ```
    
    Follow **strictly** the Problem Solving Instructions and templates above for the details of the next step. Example:
    
    ```markdown
    # NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT
    3: think_of_an_even_number
    
    ## I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
    42
