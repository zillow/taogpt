***Problem Analysis***



Some critics said this problem is not solvable due to fundamental errors. Other critics said it is solvable.

Does the task problem contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradiction in the problem statement?

Do not try to solve the problem yet, just provide analysis.

The problem statement does not contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions. It is a standard 4x4 Sudoku puzzle, which requires filling in the grid so that each column, each row, and each of the four 2x2 boxes (also called sub-grids or regions) contains all of the digits from 1 to 4. 

However, the solvability of the puzzle cannot be determined from the problem statement alone. The given puzzle is incomplete, and it is possible that multiple solutions exist, or no solution exists, depending on the missing numbers. 

In a valid Sudoku puzzle, there is only one solution. If this puzzle has more than one solution, it would be considered invalid. If it has no solution, it would also be considered invalid. 

To determine the solvability of the puzzle, we would need to attempt to solve it.

***Problem Solving Instructions***



Given problem solving session so far, choose one of the following strategies:

## Strategy: Give up on errors

If you see any errors or inconsistencies, response with the list of **specific** issues in valid JSON like this:

 `````markdown
 # BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR

```json
[
  "<issue 1 with details>",
  "<issue 2 with details>",
  // ...
]
```
`````

Do NOT try to fix the errors since Orchestrator wouldn't understand. Instead it will let you try other alternatives 
later.

## Strategy: Ask Questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Use this strategy to ask questions, but avoid obvious, trivial, 
redundant, or useless questions. You should try to ask all questions you need up front. You must follow the
following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the questions to the user.

```markdown
# I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED
<optional introductory and analysis>

1. <question> [<explanation>]
2. <question> [<explanation>]
...
```

## Strategy: Step-by-step Plan

In this strategy, the problem task is turned into a top-down, high-level, step-by-step plan of which you and 
Orchestrator will solve using tree traversal and backtracking.

* Think abstract. Come up with generic, and high-level. Avoid detailed, specific, fixed-value, and low-level ones. 
  Because it is impossible to backtrack and try different values in detailed plans in case of errors. Likewise, 
  choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. For example, choose "Find and set missing elements to fill-in 
  values" instead of "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22".
* Avoid loops if possible as they are less friendly to depth-first search for solution.
* Worship Occam's razor.

Do NOT fill in any details and do NOT work on the plan yet, Orchestrator will prompt you to work at each step later.

Follow this markdown template:

`````markdown
# HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN

```json
{
  "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
  "2": {
        "description": "<high-level description without details>",
        "sub_steps": {
            "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
            "2": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"}
        }
       },
  // ...
}
```
`````

## Strategy: Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao 
solve problems. It's stateful and previously defined globals can be used without redefining. Be tidy, avoid useless 
code comments. **Pay attention to Python indentation rules!** Follow the example below to ask Genie:

`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE

```python
print("Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer!")
(23 + 11) / 5
```
`````

Note: if the problem step asks for writing codes as the answer, provide the codes using direct answer strategy.

## Strategy: Direct Answer

Only if task problem is simple and you know the correct answer to the whole problem, you 
can answer it directly. If you need to write out any file contents, write out the content in markdown fenced code 
block under its own file section.

Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

```markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content in markdown fenced code block>
```


Important notes:
* Respect the original task problem! Do NOT alter inadvertently.

Based on proposed problem solving approaches, the state of execution, and the partial answers which can be seen in
the conversation thread, we want to determine if we are on the good track to solve the task problem and score 
the proposed approaches in the range of [0.0, 10.0], the higher the score the more preferable.

Scoring criteria: 
* If the original task problem contains error and not solvable or we are at a dead-end or infinite loop trying to 
  solve the original, then all approaches except `BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR` get 0 scores.
* Direct answers that are incorrect should get a score of 0.
* The approaches which lead to incorrect results should get a score of 0.
* The assumption implied/used should be correct.
* The questions asked by Tao should be relevant and not trivial.
* Among `HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN` strategies, choose simple, generic, and high-level over detailed, specific, 
  and low-level ones. Because it is impossible to backtrack and try different values in detailed plans in case of 
  errors. Likewise, choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. For example, choose "Find and set missing 
  elements to fill-in values" instead of "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22". Tao is good at handling details himself.
* Try to avoid identical scores (except 0's;) you can use decimal points (e.g. 9.5) to distinguish two different 
  approaches.
* Among similar approaches, mark others as duplicates of the best one; note: an approach can only duplicate another 
  approach if the two are of same kinds, e.g. two direct answers.

Response must be in valid JSON like this:

```json

  "1": {"score": 9.8, "reason": "your reasoning"},
  "2": {"score": 9.65, "duplicate_of": 1, "reason": "your explanation"},

  "2": {"score": 8.5, "reason": "This approach is similar to the first one, but it emphasizes finding and setting the missing numbers, which implies a consideration of the Sudoku constraints. However, it does not explicitly mention checking the constraints."},

Let's start solving the Sudoku puzzle quadrant by quadrant.

## Quadrant 1 (Top-left 2x2 grid)

The numbers in this quadrant are 4, 3, and 1. The missing number is 2. So, the Sudoku becomes:

```text
4 3 2 1
1 2 4 3
3 _ _ _
2 _ 3 _
```

## Quadrant 2 (Top-right 2x2 grid)

The numbers in this quadrant are 1, 3, and 4. The missing number is 2. So, the Sudoku becomes:

```text
4 3 2 1
1 2 4 3
3 4 1 2
2 _ 3 _
```

## Quadrant 3 (Bottom-left 2x2 grid)

The numbers in this quadrant are 3, 2, and 4. The missing number is 1. So, the Sudoku becomes:

```text
4 3 2 1
1 2 4 3
3 4 1 2
2 1 3 4
```

## Quadrant 4 (Bottom-right 2x2 grid)

The numbers in this quadrant are 2, 3, and 4. The missing number is 1. So, the final Sudoku solution is:

```text
4 3 2 1
1 2 4 3
3 4 1 2
2 1 3 4
```

[at step: Analyze the first quadrant of the Sudoku grid and fill in the missing number]

Let's start solving the Sudoku puzzle quadrant by quadrant.

***Quadrant 1 (Top-left 2x2 grid)***


The numbers in this quadrant are 4, 3, and 1. The missing number is 2. So, the Sudoku becomes:

```text
4 3 2 1
1 2 4 3
3 _ _ _
2 _ 3 _
```

***Quadrant 2 (Top-right 2x2 grid)***


The numbers in this quadrant are 1, 3, and 4. The missing number is 2. So, the Sudoku becomes:

```text
4 3 2 1
1 2 4 3
3 4 1 2
2 _ 3 _
```

***Quadrant 3 (Bottom-left 2x2 grid)***


The numbers in this quadrant are 3, 2, and 4. The missing number is 1. So, the Sudoku becomes:

```text
4 3 2 1
1 2 4 3
3 4 1 2
2 1 3 4
```

***Quadrant 4 (Bottom-right 2x2 grid)***


The numbers in this quadrant are 2, 3, and 4. The missing number is 1. So, the final Sudoku solution is:

```text
4 3 2 1
1 2 4 3
3 4 1 2
2 1 3 4
```

Tao, the above is your final problem solving trajectory. Please summarize it to a final answer.

Note: this is the final answer presented to the user. Therefore make sure to include **full and complete** 
information requested by the user, except existing file contents, but leave out details created during the solving 
session that the user does not need. To save spaces, don't need to repeat the file contents; instead you can refer 
to the files by path as `file:<file_name_path>`; however, if you find missing files or file contents during the 
solving session, you should write them out here.
