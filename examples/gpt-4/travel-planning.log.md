Your name is Tao. You are a diligent problem solver working with a mechanical orchestrator.

Instead of jumping to conclusions, you work to solve the problem in a recursive, top-down fashionâ€”one step at a time.

Some critics said this problem is not solvable due to fundamental errors. Other critics said it is solvable.

Does the task problem contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradiction in the problem statement?

Do not try to solve the problem yet, just provide analysis.

The task problem does not contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions in the problem statement. However, it lacks specific details that would be necessary to provide a comprehensive solution. For instance, it does not specify the starting location for the journey to Moscow. It also does not specify the mode of transportation to be used. Without these details, it is impossible to provide a specific route plan.

Instruction: given conversation so far, select **one and only one strategy** from the list below and provide a good
response in proper markdown format. For all responses, making sure you follow markdown syntax and closes all quotes
and blockquotes properly. Don't repeat the current state or answer without making progress.

## Strategy: Unsolvable, Given up

If there are fundamental **errors** or **contradictions** with the problem/task definition or the solving path thus
far, explain what issues are there and why the issues cannot be removed.

Follow this template:

```markdown
***UNSOLVABLE_I_GIVE_UP***


<explanation>
```

## Strategy: Ask Questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Use this strategy to ask questions, but avoid asking obvious, trivial, or
useless questions. You should try to ask all questions you need up front. You must follow the
following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the questions to the user.

```markdown
***I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED***


<optional introductory and analysis>

1. <question> [<explanation>]
2. <question> [<explanation>]
...
```

## Strategy: Step-by-step Plan

In this strategy, the problem task is turned into a top-down, step-by-step tree of which you and Orchestrator will
solve using tree traversal and backtracking. Thus, you should decompose the current step one-level at a time into a
list of two or more sub-tasks. If the problem step is solved in algorithmic way, create a clever, generic algorithm
but try to avoid brute-force.

Do not work on the plan yet, Orchestrator will prompt you to work at each step later. Verification steps can be
added, but instead of going back to a previous step upon failure, you should take a note of the condition and
Orchestrator will guide you by backtracking.

Follow this markdown template **strictly**:

`````markdown
***HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN***


```json
{
"1": {"description": "<step 1 description>", "why": "<explanation>"},
"2": {"description": "<step 2 description>", "why": "<explanation>"},
// ...
}
```
`````

## Strategy: Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao
solve problems. Always ask Python Genie to do the math instead of doing it in your head. Be tidy, avoid useless code
comments. **Pay attention to Python indentation rules!** Follow the example below to ask Genie:

`````markdown
***LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE***



```python
print("Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer!")
(23 + 11) / 5
```
`````

Note: if the problem step asks for writing codes as the answer, provide the codes using direct answer strategy.

## Strategy: Direct Answer

Only if task problem is simple and you know the correct answer to the whole problem, you
can answer it directly. If you need to write out any file contents, write out the content in markdown fenced code
block under its own file section.

Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

```markdown
***I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY***


<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content in markdown fenced code block>

### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT:
<next step>
```

In order to provide a detailed travel route, I need some additional information:

1. What is your current location? [This is necessary to determine the starting point of your journey.]
2. What mode of transportation do you prefer? [This will help in determining the best route for you. Options could include air travel, train, car, etc.]
3. Do you have any stops or destinations you would like to visit along the way? [This will help in planning a route that includes these locations.]

Tao has proposed the following different approaches:

***[Approach 1] I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED***



In order to provide a detailed travel route, I need some additional information:

1. What is your current location? [This is necessary to determine the starting point of your journey.]
2. What mode of transportation do you prefer? [This will help in determining the best route for you. Options could include air travel, train, car, etc.]
3. Do you have any stops or destinations you would like to visit along the way? [This will help in planning a route that includes these locations.]

***[Approach 2] I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED***



1. What is your starting location? [This information is necessary to plan the route.]
2. What mode of transportation do you prefer? [The route can vary greatly depending on whether you plan to travel by car, train, plane, etc.]

---

Based on proposed problem solving approaches, the state of execution, and the partial answers which can be seen in
the conversation thread, we want to determine if we are on the good track to solve the task problem and score
the proposed approaches in the range of [0.0, 10.0], the higher the score the more preferable.

Scoring criteria:
* If the original task problem contains error and not solvable or we are at a dead-end or infinite loop trying to
solve the original, then all approaches except `UNSOLVABLE_I_GIVE_UP` get 0 scores.
* The approach must conform to the templates for Tao and parsable; else it should get a score of 0.
* Direct answers that are incorrect should get a score of 0.
* The approaches which lead to incorrect results should get a score of 0.
* The assumption implied/used should be correct.
* The questions asked by Tao should be relevant and non-redundant.
* The approach which looks more efficient and avoids unnecessary works is preferred.
* Try to avoid identical scores (except 0's;) you can use decimal points (e.g. 9.5) to
distinguish two different approaches.
* But if two approaches are nearly identical except wordings or details of explanation, mark the later one as a
duplicate of the first; note: an approach can only duplicate another approach if the two are of same kinds, e.g.
two direct answers.

Response must be in valid JSON like this:

Based on proposed problem solving approaches, the state of execution, and the partial answers which can be seen in
the conversation thread, we want to determine if we are on the good track to solve the task problem and score
the proposed approaches in the range of [0.0, 10.0], the higher the score the more preferable.

Scoring criteria:
* If the original task problem contains error and not solvable or we are at a dead-end or infinite loop trying to
solve the original, then all approaches except `UNSOLVABLE_I_GIVE_UP` get 0 scores.
* The approach must conform to the templates for Tao and parsable; else it should get a score of 0.
* Direct answers that are incorrect should get a score of 0.
* The approaches which lead to incorrect results should get a score of 0.
* The assumption implied/used should be correct.
* The questions asked by Tao should be relevant and non-redundant.
* The approach which looks more efficient and avoids unnecessary works is preferred.
* Try to avoid identical scores (except 0's;) you can use decimal points (e.g. 9.5) to
distinguish two different approaches.
* But if two approaches are nearly identical except wordings or details of explanation, mark the later one as a
duplicate of the first; note: an approach can only duplicate another approach if the two are of same kinds, e.g.
two direct answers.

Response must be in valid JSON like this:

```json
{
"1": {"score": 9.8, "reason": "your reasoning"},
"2": {"score": 9.65, "duplicate_of": 1, "reason": "your explanation"}

Instruction: given conversation so far, select **one and only one strategy** from the list below and provide a good
response in proper markdown format. For all responses, making sure you follow markdown syntax and closes all quotes
and blockquotes properly. Don't repeat the current state or answer without making progress.

## Strategy: Unsolvable, Given up

If there are fundamental **errors** or **contradictions** with the problem/task definition or the solving path thus
far, explain what issues are there and why the issues cannot be removed.

Follow this template:

```markdown
***UNSOLVABLE_I_GIVE_UP***


<explanation>
```

## Strategy: Ask Questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Use this strategy to ask questions, but avoid asking obvious, trivial, or
useless questions. You should try to ask all questions you need up front. You must follow the
following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the questions to the user.

```markdown
***I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED***


<optional introductory and analysis>

1. <question> [<explanation>]
2. <question> [<explanation>]
...
```

## Strategy: Step-by-step Plan

In this strategy, the problem task is turned into a top-down, step-by-step tree of which you and Orchestrator will
solve using tree traversal and backtracking. Thus, you should decompose the current step one-level at a time into a
list of two or more sub-tasks. If the problem step is solved in algorithmic way, create a clever, generic algorithm
but try to avoid brute-force.

Do not work on the plan yet, Orchestrator will prompt you to work at each step later. Verification steps can be
added, but instead of going back to a previous step upon failure, you should take a note of the condition and
Orchestrator will guide you by backtracking.

Follow this markdown template **strictly**:

`````markdown
***HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN***


```json
{
"1": {"description": "<step 1 description>", "why": "<explanation>"},
"2": {"description": "<step 2 description>", "why": "<explanation>"},
// ...
}
```
`````

## Strategy: Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao
solve problems. Always ask Python Genie to do the math instead of doing it in your head. Be tidy, avoid useless code
comments. **Pay attention to Python indentation rules!** Follow the example below to ask Genie:

`````markdown
***LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE***



```python
print("Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer!")
(23 + 11) / 5
```
`````

Note: if the problem step asks for writing codes as the answer, provide the codes using direct answer strategy.

## Strategy: Direct Answer

Go with this strategy if the step is simple and you know the correct answer. You should also tell the Orchestrator
which step you want to work at next in the `NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section. If you need to write out any file
contents, write out the content in markdown fenced code block under its own file section.

Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

```markdown
***I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY***


<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content in markdown fenced code block>

### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT:
<next step>
```


Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Response template:

```markdown
***I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY***

Traveling by train or car from Urumuqi to Beijing is a long journey, but it's feasible. You will need to prepare for a long trip, ensure you have all necessary supplies, and plan for rest stops along the way.

If you choose to travel by train, you can take the Lianzhou Express, which runs from Urumuqi to Beijing. The journey takes approximately 30 hours.

If you choose to travel by car, the journey is approximately 3,400 kilometers and takes around 40 hours of driving time. You would need to plan for overnight stops. The route would likely take you through cities such as Lanzhou and Taiyuan.

Remember to check the local COVID-19 guidelines and restrictions for each city you plan to stop in.

Traveling from Beijing to Moscow via the Trans-Siberian Railway is a unique and exciting journey. The Trans-Siberian Railway is the longest railway line in the world, spanning a distance of 9,289 kilometers from Moscow to Vladivostok. However, you will be taking a branch of this railway, known as the Trans-Mongolian line, which connects Beijing to Moscow.

Here's a step-by-step plan for this part of your journey:

1. Purchase a ticket for the Trans-Mongolian Railway from Beijing to Moscow. The train departs from Beijing Railway Station. The journey takes about six days, so you will need to prepare for a long trip.

2. Pack enough food, water, and other essentials for the journey. The train does have a dining car, but it's always good to have your own supplies as well.

3. Make sure you have all necessary travel documents. You will be crossing international borders, so you will need a valid passport and visas for Mongolia and Russia.

4. Enjoy the journey! The Trans-Mongolian Railway offers stunning views of the Mongolian steppe and the Siberian wilderness.

5. Arrive in Moscow. The train terminates at Moscow Yaroslavsky railway station.

Remember to check the local COVID-19 guidelines and restrictions for each country you plan to travel through.

Traveling by train or car from Urumuqi to Beijing is a long journey, but it's feasible. You will need to prepare for a long trip, ensure you have all necessary supplies, and plan for rest stops along the way.

If you choose to travel by train, you can take the Lianzhou Express, which runs from Urumuqi to Beijing. The journey takes approximately 30 hours.

If you choose to travel by car, the journey is approximately 3,400 kilometers and takes around 40 hours of driving time. You would need to plan for overnight stops. The route would likely take you through cities such as Lanzhou and Taiyuan.

Remember to check the local COVID-19 guidelines and restrictions for each city you plan to stop in.

Packing enough food, water, and other essentials for the journey is crucial. Since the journey from Beijing to Moscow via the Trans-Mongolian Railway takes about six days, you need to ensure you have enough supplies for this period.

Here's a list of essentials you might need:

1. Food: Pack non-perishable food items like canned goods, dried fruits, nuts, and energy bars. You can also bring instant noodles or soup packets that can be prepared with hot water.

2. Water: While you can buy bottled water on the train, it's always a good idea to have your own supply. Consider bringing a reusable water bottle that you can refill.

3. Medication: If you take any regular medication, make sure to bring enough for the duration of the journey. It's also wise to pack a basic first aid kit with band-aids, antiseptic wipes, and pain relievers.

4. Entertainment: The journey is long, so bring books, a music player, or other forms of entertainment to keep yourself occupied.

5. Personal hygiene items: Don't forget items like toothpaste, toothbrush, soap, and toilet paper.

6. Clothing: Pack enough clothes for the journey, considering the weather conditions. Don't forget to pack a warm jacket or blanket as it can get cold on the train.

Remember, it's better to be over-prepared than under-prepared.

Ensuring you have all necessary travel documents is crucial for a smooth journey. Here's a checklist of the documents you should have:

1. Passport: Your passport should be valid for at least six months beyond your period of stay.

2. Visas: You will need visas for both Mongolia and Russia. You can apply for these at the respective embassies in your country. Make sure to check the processing times and apply well in advance of your travel dates.

3. Tickets: Keep a copy of your train ticket from Beijing to Moscow.

4. Insurance: It's recommended to have travel insurance that covers medical expenses, trip cancellation, lost luggage, etc.

5. Health documents: Depending on the current health situation, you might need proof of vaccinations or negative COVID-19 test results.

Remember to keep these documents safe and easily accessible during your journey.

Packing enough food, water, and other essentials for the journey is crucial. Since the journey from Beijing to Moscow via the Trans-Mongolian Railway takes about six days, you need to ensure you have enough supplies for this period.

Here's a list of essentials you might need:

1. Food: Pack non-perishable food items like canned goods, dried fruits, nuts, and energy bars. You can also bring instant noodles or soup packets that can be prepared with hot water.

2. Water: While you can buy bottled water on the train, it's always a good idea to have your own supply. Consider bringing a reusable water bottle that you can refill.

3. Medication: If you take any regular medication, make sure to bring enough for the duration of the journey. It's also wise to pack a basic first aid kit with band-aids, antiseptic wipes, and pain relievers.

4. Entertainment: The journey is long, so bring books, a music player, or other forms of entertainment to keep yourself occupied.

5. Personal hygiene items: Don't forget items like toothpaste, toothbrush, soap, and toilet paper.

6. Clothing: Pack enough clothes for the journey, considering the weather conditions. Don't forget to pack a warm jacket or blanket as it can get cold on the train.

Packing enough food, water, and other essentials for the journey is crucial. Since the journey from Beijing to Moscow via the Trans-Mongolian Railway takes about six days, you need to ensure you have enough supplies for this period.

Here's a list of essentials you might need:

1. Food: Pack non-perishable food items like canned goods, dried fruits, nuts, and energy bars. You can also bring instant noodles or soup packets that can be prepared with hot water.

2. Water: While you can buy bottled water on the train, it's always a good idea to have your own supply. Consider bringing a reusable water bottle that you can refill.

3. Medication: If you take any regular medication, make sure to bring enough for the duration of the journey. It's also wise to pack a basic first aid kit with band-aids, antiseptic wipes, and pain relievers.

4. Entertainment: The journey is long, so bring books, a music player, or other forms of entertainment to keep yourself occupied.

5. Personal hygiene items: Don't forget items like toothpaste, toothbrush, soap, and toilet paper.

6. Clothing: Pack enough clothes for the journey, considering the weather conditions. Don't forget to pack a warm jacket or blanket as it can get cold on the train.

Remember, it's better to be over-prepared than under-prepared.

Packing enough food, water, and other essentials for the journey is crucial. Since the journey from Beijing to Moscow via the Trans-Mongolian Railway takes about six days, you need to ensure you have enough supplies for this period.

Here's a list of essentials you might need:

1. Food: Pack non-perishable food items like canned goods, dried fruits, nuts, and energy bars. You can also bring instant noodles or soup packets that can be prepared with hot water.

2. Water: While you can buy bottled water on the train, it's always a good idea to have your own supply. Consider bringing a reusable water bottle that you can refill.

3. Medication: If you take any regular medication, make sure to bring enough for the duration of the journey. It's also wise to pack a basic first aid kit with band-aids, antiseptic wipes, and pain relievers.

4. Entertainment: The journey is long, so bring books, a music player, or other forms of entertainment to keep yourself occupied.

5. Personal hygiene items: Don't forget items like toothpaste, toothbrush, soap, and toilet paper.

6. Clothing: Pack enough clothes for the journey, considering the weather conditions. Don't forget to pack a warm jacket or blanket as it can get cold on the train.

Remember, it's better to be over-prepared than under-prepared.

3. Tickets: Keep a copy of your train ticket from Beijing to Moscow.

4. Insurance: It's recommended to have travel insurance that covers medical expenses, trip cancellation, lost luggage, etc.
