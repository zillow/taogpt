***Problem Analysis***



Some critics said this problem is not solvable due to fundamental errors. Other critics said it is solvable.

Does the task problem contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradiction in the problem statement?

Do not try to solve the problem yet, just provide analysis.

The problem statement does not contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions. It is a standard 4x4 Sudoku puzzle. 

In Sudoku, the objective is to fill a grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to the grid size. In this case, the grid size is 4, so the digits are 1 to 4. 

The puzzle is solvable if there is a unique solution that satisfies these conditions. The puzzle provided has some cells already filled, and it is our task to fill the remaining cells. 

The only way to determine if the puzzle is solvable is to attempt to solve it. If we can fill in the remaining cells such that each row, column, and 2x2 subgrid contains the digits 1 to 4 exactly once, then the puzzle is solvable. If not, then the puzzle is not solvable.

***Problem Solving Instructions***



Given problem solving session so far, choose one of the following strategies:

## Strategy: Give up on errors

If you see any errors or inconsistencies, response with the list of **specific** issues in valid JSON like this:

 `````markdown
 # BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR

```json
[
  "<issue 1 with details>",
  "<issue 2 with details>",
  // ...
]
```
`````

Do NOT try to fix the errors since Orchestrator wouldn't understand. Instead it will let you try other alternatives 
later.

## Strategy: Ask Questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Use this strategy to ask questions, but avoid obvious, trivial, 
redundant, or useless questions. You should try to ask all questions you need up front. You must follow the
following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the questions to the user.

```markdown
# I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED
<optional introductory and analysis>

1. <question> [<explanation>]
2. <question> [<explanation>]
...
```

## Strategy: Step-by-step Plan

In this strategy, the problem task is turned into a top-down, high-level, step-by-step plan of which you and 
Orchestrator will solve using tree traversal and backtracking.

* Think abstract. Come up with generic, and high-level. Avoid detailed, specific, fixed-value, and low-level ones. 
  Because it is impossible to backtrack and try different values in detailed plans in case of errors. Likewise, 
  choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. For example, choose "Find and set missing elements to fill-in 
  values" instead of "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22".
* Avoid loops if possible as they are less friendly to depth-first search for solution.
* Worship Occam's razor.

Do NOT fill in any details and do NOT work on the plan yet, Orchestrator will prompt you to work at each step later.

Follow this markdown template:

`````markdown
# HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN

```json
{
  "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
  "2": {
        "description": "<high-level description without details>",
        "sub_steps": {
            "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
            "2": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"}
        }
       },
  // ...
}
```
`````

## Strategy: Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao 
solve problems. It's stateful and previously defined globals can be used without redefining. Be tidy, avoid useless 
code comments. **Pay attention to Python indentation rules!** Follow the example below to ask Genie:

`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE

```python
print("Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer!")
(23 + 11) / 5
```
`````

Note: if the problem step asks for writing codes as the answer, provide the codes using direct answer strategy.

## Strategy: Direct Answer

Only if task problem is simple and you know the correct answer to the whole problem, you 
can answer it directly. If you need to write out any file contents, write out the content in markdown fenced code 
block under its own file section.

Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

```markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content in markdown fenced code block>
```


Important notes:
* Respect the original task problem! Do NOT alter inadvertently.

Based on proposed problem solving approaches, the state of execution, and the partial answers which can be seen in
the conversation thread, we want to determine if we are on the good track to solve the task problem and score 
the proposed approaches in the range of [0.0, 10.0], the higher the score the more preferable.

Scoring criteria: 
* If the original task problem contains error and not solvable or we are at a dead-end or infinite loop trying to 
  solve the original, then all approaches except `BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR` get 0 scores.
* Direct answers that are incorrect should get a score of 0.
* The approaches which lead to incorrect results should get a score of 0.
* The assumption implied/used should be correct.
* The questions asked by Tao should be relevant and not trivial.
* Among `HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN` strategies, choose simple, generic, and high-level over detailed, specific, 
  and low-level ones. Because it is impossible to backtrack and try different values in detailed plans in case of 
  errors. Likewise, choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. For example, choose "Find and set missing 
  elements to fill-in values" instead of "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22". Tao is good at handling details himself.
* Try to avoid identical scores (except 0's;) you can use decimal points (e.g. 9.5) to distinguish two different 
  approaches.
* Among similar approaches, mark others as duplicates of the best one; note: an approach can only duplicate another 
  approach if the two are of same kinds, e.g. two direct answers.

***Problem Solving Instructions***



Given problem solving session so far, choose one of the following strategies:

## Strategy: Give up on errors

If you see any errors or inconsistencies, response with the list of **specific** issues in valid JSON like this:

 `````markdown
 # BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR

```json
[
  "<issue 1 with details>",
  "<issue 2 with details>",
  // ...
]
```
`````

Do NOT try to fix the errors since Orchestrator wouldn't understand. Instead it will let you try other alternatives 
later.

## Strategy: Ask Questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Use this strategy to ask questions, but avoid obvious, trivial, 
redundant, or useless questions. You should try to ask all questions you need up front. You must follow the
following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the questions to the user.

```markdown
# I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED
<optional introductory and analysis>

1. <question> [<explanation>]
2. <question> [<explanation>]
...
```

## Strategy: Step-by-step Plan

In this strategy, the problem task is turned into a top-down, high-level, step-by-step plan of which you and 
Orchestrator will solve using tree traversal and backtracking.

* Think abstract. Come up with generic, and high-level. Avoid detailed, specific, fixed-value, and low-level ones. 
  Because it is impossible to backtrack and try different values in detailed plans in case of errors. Likewise, 
  choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. For example, choose "Find and set missing elements to fill-in 
  values" instead of "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22".
* Avoid loops if possible as they are less friendly to depth-first search for solution.
* Worship Occam's razor.

Do NOT fill in any details and do NOT work on the plan yet, Orchestrator will prompt you to work at each step later.

Follow this markdown template:

`````markdown
# HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN

```json
{
  "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
  "2": {
        "description": "<high-level description without details>",
        "sub_steps": {
            "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
            "2": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"}
        }
       },
  // ...
}
```
`````

## Strategy: Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao 
solve problems. It's stateful and previously defined globals can be used without redefining. Be tidy, avoid useless 
code comments. **Pay attention to Python indentation rules!** Follow the example below to ask Genie:

`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE

```python
print("Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer!")
(23 + 11) / 5
```
`````

Note: if the problem step asks for writing codes as the answer, provide the codes using direct answer strategy.

## Strategy: Direct Answer

Go with this strategy if the step is simple and you know the correct answer. You should also tell the Orchestrator 
which step you want to work at next in the `NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section. If you need to write out any file
contents, write out the content in markdown fenced code block under its own file section.

Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

```markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content in markdown fenced code block>

### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT:

***Problem Analysis***



The problem statement does not contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions. It is a standard 4x4 Sudoku puzzle. 

In Sudoku, the objective is to fill a grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to the grid size. In this case, the grid size is 4, so the digits are 1 to 4. 

The puzzle is solvable if there is a unique solution that satisfies these conditions. The puzzle provided has some cells already filled, and it is our task to fill the remaining cells. 

The only way to determine if the puzzle is solvable is to attempt to solve it. If we can fill in the remaining cells such that each row, column, and 2x2 subgrid contains the digits 1 to 4 exactly once, then the puzzle is solvable. If not, then the puzzle is not solvable.

***Problem Analysis***



The problem statement does not contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions. It is a standard 4x4 Sudoku puzzle. 

In Sudoku, the objective is to fill a grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to the grid size. In this case, the grid size is 4, so the digits are 1 to 4. 

The puzzle is solvable if there is a unique solution that satisfies these conditions. The puzzle provided has some cells already filled, and it is our task to fill the remaining cells. 

The only way to determine if the puzzle is solvable is to attempt to solve it. If we can fill in the remaining cells such that each row, column, and 2x2 subgrid contains the digits 1 to 4 exactly once, then the puzzle is solvable. If not, then the puzzle is not solvable.

***Problem Solving Instructions***



Given problem solving session so far, choose one of the following strategies:

## Strategy: Give up on errors

If you see any errors or inconsistencies, response with the list of **specific** issues in valid JSON like this:

 `````markdown
 # BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR

```json
[
  "<issue 1 with details>",
  "<issue 2 with details>",
  // ...
]
```
`````

Do NOT try to fix the errors since Orchestrator wouldn't understand. Instead it will let you try other alternatives 
later.

## Strategy: Ask Questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Use this strategy to ask questions, but avoid obvious, trivial, 
redundant, or useless questions. You should try to ask all questions you need up front. You must follow the
following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the questions to the user.

```markdown
# I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED
<optional introductory and analysis>

1. <question> [<explanation>]
2. <question> [<explanation>]
...
```

## Strategy: Step-by-step Plan

In this strategy, the problem task is turned into a top-down, high-level, step-by-step plan of which you and 
Orchestrator will solve using tree traversal and backtracking.

* Think abstract. Come up with generic, and high-level. Avoid detailed, specific, fixed-value, and low-level ones. 
  Because it is impossible to backtrack and try different values in detailed plans in case of errors. Likewise, 
  choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. For example, choose "Find and set missing elements to fill-in 
  values" instead of "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22".
* Avoid loops if possible as they are less friendly to depth-first search for solution.
* Worship Occam's razor.

Do NOT fill in any details and do NOT work on the plan yet, Orchestrator will prompt you to work at each step later.

Follow this markdown template:

`````markdown
# HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN

```json
{
  "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
  "2": {
        "description": "<high-level description without details>",
        "sub_steps": {
            "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
            "2": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"}
        }
       },
  // ...
}
```
`````

## Strategy: Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao 
solve problems. It's stateful and previously defined globals can be used without redefining. Be tidy, avoid useless 
code comments. **Pay attention to Python indentation rules!** Follow the example below to ask Genie:

`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE

```python
print("Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer!")
(23 + 11) / 5
```
`````

Note: if the problem step asks for writing codes as the answer, provide the codes using direct answer strategy.

## Strategy: Direct Answer

Go with this strategy if the step is simple and you know the correct answer. You should also tell the Orchestrator 
which step you want to work at next in the `NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section. If you need to write out any file
contents, write out the content in markdown fenced code block under its own file section.

Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

```markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content in markdown fenced code block>

### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT:
<next step ID: description> or "None. This is the final step."
```


Important notes:
* Respect the original task problem! Do NOT alter inadvertently.

Tao, which step you want to work on next? You can choose one of the options below.

1) Finish the task by summarizing the final answer. Use the `# FINAL_ANSWER` strategy.
2) Finish the task by giving up. Use the `# BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR` strategy.
3) Choose the next step to work on. You can choose the next step and get start working on it using the following 
   template. You're encouraged to choose from the steps planned earlier but you can also take a detour from the 
   earlier plan.
