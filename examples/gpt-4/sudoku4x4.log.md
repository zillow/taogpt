***Problem Analysis***



Some critics said this problem is not solvable due to fundamental errors. Other critics said it is solvable.

Does the task problem contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradiction in the problem statement?

Do not try to solve the problem yet, just provide analysis.

The problem statement does not contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions. It is a standard 4x4 Sudoku puzzle, where each row, each column, and each 4x4 grid must contain all of the digits from 1 to 4. 

The only potential issue is whether the given puzzle is solvable or not. In a valid Sudoku puzzle, there should be only one solution. If there are multiple solutions or no solutions, then the puzzle is not valid. However, without attempting to solve the puzzle, we cannot determine whether it is valid or not. 

The problem statement does not provide any information that would allow us to determine the validity of the puzzle without attempting to solve it. Therefore, the next step would be to attempt to solve the puzzle.

***Problem Solving Instructions***



Given problem solving session so far, choose one of the following strategies:

## Strategy: Give up on errors

If you see any errors or inconsistencies, response with the list of **specific** issues in valid JSON like this:

 `````markdown
 # BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR

```json
[
  "<issue 1>",
  "<issue 2>",
  // ...
]
```
`````

Do NOT try to fix the errors since Orchestrator wouldn't understand. Instead it will let you try other alternatives 
later.

## Strategy: Ask Questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Use this strategy to ask questions, but avoid obvious, trivial, 
redundant, or useless questions. You should try to ask all questions you need up front. You must follow the
following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the questions to the user.

```markdown
# I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED
<optional introductory and analysis>

1. <question> [<explanation>]
2. <question> [<explanation>]
...
```

## Strategy: Step-by-step Plan

In this strategy, the problem task is turned into a top-down, step-by-step plan of which you and Orchestrator will 
solve using tree traversal and backtracking.

* Think abstract and worship Occam's razor. Prefer elegant, generic steps. Avoid overly specific and detailed steps; 
  you will be working on the steps later. For example, prefer "Set suitable value to missing elements" over "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22".
* Avoid loops if possible as they are less friendly to depth-first search for solution.
* Cherish verifiability.

Do NOT work on the plan yet, Orchestrator will prompt you to work at each step later.

Follow this markdown template **strictly**:

`````markdown
# HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN

```json
{
  "1": {"description": "<brief description>"},
  "2": {
        "description": "<brief description>",
        "sub_steps": {
            "1": {"description": "<brief description>"},
            "2": {"description": "<brief description>"}
        }
       },
  // ...
}
```
`````

## Strategy: Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao 
solve problems. It's stateful and previously defined globals can be used without redefining. Be tidy, avoid useless 
code comments. **Pay attention to Python indentation rules!** Follow the example below to ask Genie:

`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE

```python
print("Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer!")
(23 + 11) / 5
```
`````

Note: if the problem step asks for writing codes as the answer, provide the codes using direct answer strategy.

## Strategy: Direct Answer

Only if task problem is simple and you know the correct answer to the whole problem, you 
can answer it directly. If you need to write out any file contents, write out the content in markdown fenced code 
block under its own file section.

Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

```markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content in markdown fenced code block>
```


Important notes:
* Respect the original task problem! Do NOT alter inadvertently.

Tao, please proceed to solve the problem following the "Problem Solving Instructions" above. Be sure to start with 
one of the headings: `# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY`, `# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE`, `# BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR`,

This plan is based on the rules of Sudoku. Each row, column, and 2x2 grid must contain all of the digits from 1 to 4 exactly once. Therefore, we can fill the empty cells in each row one by one. For each row, we look at the numbers that are already filled in, and then fill the empty cells with the remaining numbers. We also need to make sure that the numbers we fill in do not violate the Sudoku rules for the columns and 2x2 grids.

***[Approach 2] HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN***



```json
{

  "2": {"description": "Move to the next empty cell and repeat step 1"},

}
```

---

Based on proposed problem solving approaches, the state of execution, and the partial answers which can be seen in
the conversation thread, we want to determine if we are on the good track to solve the task problem and score 
the proposed approaches in the range of [0.0, 10.0], the higher the score the more preferable.

Scoring criteria: 
* If the original task problem contains error and not solvable or we are at a dead-end or infinite loop trying to 
  solve the original, then all approaches except `BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR` get 0 scores.
* Direct answers that are incorrect should get a score of 0.
* The approaches which lead to incorrect results should get a score of 0.
* The assumption implied/used should be correct.
* The questions asked by Tao should be relevant and not trivial.
* For `HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN` approaches:
  * Worship Occam's razor. Prefer simpler, linear, decomposable steps without looping if possible. Loops are less 
    friendly to the top-down tree search problem solving method. Tao will backtrack by himself when things go wrong, 
    so no need to mention it in the step-by-step plan.
  * Think abstract. Prefer **elegant, generic, and high-level** plans. Avoid detailed, low-level, overly 
    specific steps. For example, prefer "Find and set missing elements to fill-in values" over "Set 2nd and 5th 
    elements to 22".
  * **Do NOT worry too much about the details in the plan**; Tao can work on the details later.
* Try to avoid identical scores (except 0's;) you can use decimal points (e.g. 9.5) to distinguish two different 
  approaches.
* Among similar approaches, mark others as duplicates of the best one; note: an approach can only duplicate another 
  approach if the two are of same kinds, e.g. two direct answers.

Response must be in valid JSON like this:

***Problem Solving Instructions***



Given problem solving session so far, choose one of the following strategies:

## Strategy: Give up on errors

If you see any errors or inconsistencies, response with the list of **specific** issues in valid JSON like this:

 `````markdown
 # BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR

```json
[
  "<issue 1>",
  "<issue 2>",
  // ...
]
```
`````

Do NOT try to fix the errors since Orchestrator wouldn't understand. Instead it will let you try other alternatives 
later.

## Strategy: Ask Questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Use this strategy to ask questions, but avoid obvious, trivial, 
redundant, or useless questions. You should try to ask all questions you need up front. You must follow the
following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the questions to the user.

```markdown
# I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED
<optional introductory and analysis>

1. <question> [<explanation>]
2. <question> [<explanation>]
...
```

## Strategy: Step-by-step Plan

In this strategy, the problem task is turned into a top-down, step-by-step plan of which you and Orchestrator will 
solve using tree traversal and backtracking.

* Think abstract and worship Occam's razor. Prefer elegant, generic steps. Avoid overly specific and detailed steps; 
  you will be working on the steps later. For example, prefer "Set suitable value to missing elements" over "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22".
* Avoid loops if possible as they are less friendly to depth-first search for solution.
* Cherish verifiability.

Do NOT work on the plan yet, Orchestrator will prompt you to work at each step later.

Follow this markdown template **strictly**:

`````markdown
# HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN

```json
{
  "1": {"description": "<brief description>"},
  "2": {
        "description": "<brief description>",
        "sub_steps": {
            "1": {"description": "<brief description>"},
            "2": {"description": "<brief description>"}
        }
       },
  // ...
}
```
`````

## Strategy: Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao 
solve problems. It's stateful and previously defined globals can be used without redefining. Be tidy, avoid useless 
code comments. **Pay attention to Python indentation rules!** Follow the example below to ask Genie:

`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE

```python
print("Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer!")
(23 + 11) / 5
```
`````

Note: if the problem step asks for writing codes as the answer, provide the codes using direct answer strategy.

## Strategy: Direct Answer

Go with this strategy if the step is simple and you know the correct answer. You should also tell the Orchestrator 
which step you want to work at next in the `NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section. If you need to write out any file
contents, write out the content in markdown fenced code block under its own file section.

Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

```markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content in markdown fenced code block>

### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT:

The first empty cell is in the first row and third column. The numbers that are already in the first row are 4, 3, and 1. The numbers that are already in the third column are 4 and 3. The numbers that are already in the top left 2x2 grid are 4, 3, and 1. Therefore, the only number that can be placed in the first empty cell is 2.

The updated Sudoku puzzle is:

***Problem Analysis***



The problem statement does not contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions. It is a standard 4x4 Sudoku puzzle, where each row, each column, and each 4x4 grid must contain all of the digits from 1 to 4. 

The only potential issue is whether the given puzzle is solvable or not. In a valid Sudoku puzzle, there should be only one solution. If there are multiple solutions or no solutions, then the puzzle is not valid. However, without attempting to solve the puzzle, we cannot determine whether it is valid or not. 

The problem statement does not provide any information that would allow us to determine the validity of the puzzle without attempting to solve it. Therefore, the next step would be to attempt to solve the puzzle.

***Problem Analysis***



The problem statement does not contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions. It is a standard 4x4 Sudoku puzzle, where each row, each column, and each 4x4 grid must contain all of the digits from 1 to 4. 

The only potential issue is whether the given puzzle is solvable or not. In a valid Sudoku puzzle, there should be only one solution. If there are multiple solutions or no solutions, then the puzzle is not valid. However, without attempting to solve the puzzle, we cannot determine whether it is valid or not. 

The problem statement does not provide any information that would allow us to determine the validity of the puzzle without attempting to solve it. Therefore, the next step would be to attempt to solve the puzzle.

Tao, the above is your final problem solving trajectory. Please summarize it to a final answer.

Note: if you use any files written during the problem solving above, to save spaces, you don't need to repeat the file 
contents; instead you can refer to the files by path as `file:file_name_path`, for example: 

```markdown
The python program you need is contained in the files:

1. file:my_module/__init__.py
2. file:my_module/main.py
