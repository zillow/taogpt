Some critics said this problem is not solvable due to fundamental errors. Other critics said it is solvable.

Does the task problem contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradiction in the problem statement?

Do not try to solve the problem yet, just provide analysis.

The problem statement seems to be clear and does not contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions. It asks for a Python method to calculate the scores of each player in a game of Weiqi (also known as Go) using the Chinese rules for scoring. The board state is represented as a N-by-N array with each element representing a grid point state using `BLACK`, `WHITE`, or `EMPTY`. The task is to return a tuple of (black_score, white_score). 

However, it's important to note that scoring a game of Weiqi is a complex task that involves more than just counting the number of stones for each player. According to the Chinese rules, the score for a player is the number of stones the player has on the board plus the number of empty points that are completely surrounded by that player's stones. This means that the function will need to implement a way to identify and count these surrounded empty points, which can be a challenging task. 

Additionally, the problem statement does not specify what should be done in case of "seki" situations, where both players have stones in an area but neither can capture the other's without risking their own stones. In Chinese rules, these points are typically not counted for either player, but the problem statement does not specify how these should be handled. 

In conclusion, while the problem statement is clear and does not contain errors or contradictions, the task it sets out is complex and requires a good understanding of the rules of Weiqi.

Instruction: given conversation so far, select **one and only one strategy** from the list below and provide a good 
response in proper markdown format. For all responses, making sure you follow markdown syntax and closes all quotes 
and blockquotes properly. Don't repeat the current state or answer without making progress.

## Strategy: Unsolvable, Given up

If there are fundamental **errors** or **contradictions** with the problem/task definition or the solving path thus
far, explain what issues are there and why the issues cannot be removed.

Follow this template:

```markdown
# UNSOLVABLE_I_GIVE_UP
<explanation>
```

## Strategy: Ask Questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Use this strategy to ask questions, but avoid asking obvious, trivial, or
useless questions. You should try to ask all questions you need up front. You must follow the
following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the questions to the user.

```markdown
# I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED
<optional introductory and analysis>

1. <question> [<explanation>]
2. <question> [<explanation>]
...
```

## Strategy: Step-by-step Plan

In this strategy, the problem task is turned into a top-down, step-by-step tree of which you and Orchestrator will 
solve using tree traversal and backtracking. Thus, you should decompose the current step one-level at a time into a 
list of two or more sub-tasks. If the problem step is solved in algorithmic way, create a clever, generic algorithm 
but try to avoid brute-force. 

Do not work on the plan yet, Orchestrator will prompt you to work at each step later. Verification steps can be 
added, but instead of going back to a previous step upon failure, you should take a note of the condition and 
Orchestrator will guide you by backtracking.

Follow this markdown template **strictly**:

`````markdown
# HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN
```json
{
  "1": {"description": "<step 1 description>", "why": "<explanation>"},
  "2": {"description": "<step 2 description>", "why": "<explanation>"},
  // ...
}
```
`````

## Strategy: Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao 
solve problems. Always ask Python Genie to do the math instead of doing it in your head. Be tidy, avoid useless code 
comments. **Pay attention to Python indentation rules!** Follow the example below to ask Genie:

`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE

```python
print("Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer!")
(23 + 11) / 5
```
`````

Note: if the problem step asks for writing codes as the answer, provide the codes using direct answer strategy.

## Strategy: Direct Answer

Only if task problem is simple and you know the correct answer to the whole problem, you 
can answer it directly. If you need to write out any file contents, write out the content in markdown fenced code 
block under its own file section.

Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

```markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY

To initialize the scores for black and white to 0, we can simply declare two variables `black_score` and `white_score` and set them to 0 at the beginning of our function. This will give us a starting point to increment the scores as we iterate over the board.

Here is the Python code for this step:

```python
def score_game(board):
    """
    board: a N-by-N array where each element representing a grid point state using `BLACK`, `WHITE`, or `EMPTY`.
    return a tuple of (black_score, white_score)
    """
    black_score = 0
    white_score = 0
    # Rest of the function will go here
```

To iterate over each cell in the board, we can use a nested for loop. The outer loop will iterate over each row of the board, and the inner loop will iterate over each cell in the current row. This will allow us to access each cell of the board exactly once.

Here is the Python code for this step:

```python
def score_game(board):
    """
    board: a N-by-N array where each element representing a grid point state using `BLACK`, `WHITE`, or `EMPTY`.
    return a tuple of (black_score, white_score)
    """
    black_score = 0
    white_score = 0

    for row in board:
        for cell in row:
            # Rest of the function will go here

    # Rest of the function will go here
```

The problem statement seems to be clear and does not contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions. It asks for a Python method to calculate the scores of each player in a game of Weiqi (also known as Go) using the Chinese rules for scoring. The board state is represented as a N-by-N array with each element representing a grid point state using `BLACK`, `WHITE`, or `EMPTY`. The task is to return a tuple of (black_score, white_score). 

However, it's important to note that scoring a game of Weiqi is a complex task that involves more than just counting the number of stones for each player. According to the Chinese rules, the score for a player is the number of stones the player has on the board plus the number of empty points that are completely surrounded by that player's stones. This means that the function will need to implement a way to identify and count these surrounded empty points, which can be a challenging task. 

Additionally, the problem statement does not specify what should be done in case of "seki" situations, where both players have stones in an area but neither can capture the other's without risking their own stones. In Chinese rules, these points are typically not counted for either player, but the problem statement does not specify how these should be handled. 

In conclusion, while the problem statement is clear and does not contain errors or contradictions, the task it sets out is complex and requires a good understanding of the rules of Weiqi.

Here is the Python code for this step:

```python
def score_game(board):
    """
    board: a N-by-N array where each element representing a grid point state using `BLACK`, `WHITE`, or `EMPTY`.

    for row in board:

            if cell == BLACK:
                black_score += 1

The problem statement seems to be clear and does not contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions. It asks for a Python method to calculate the scores of each player in a game of Weiqi (also known as Go) using the Chinese rules for scoring. The board state is represented as a N-by-N array with each element representing a grid point state using `BLACK`, `WHITE`, or `EMPTY`. The task is to return a tuple of (black_score, white_score). 

However, it's important to note that scoring a game of Weiqi is a complex task that involves more than just counting the number of stones for each player. According to the Chinese rules, the score for a player is the number of stones the player has on the board plus the number of empty points that are completely surrounded by that player's stones. This means that the function will need to implement a way to identify and count these surrounded empty points, which can be a challenging task. 

Additionally, the problem statement does not specify what should be done in case of "seki" situations, where both players have stones in an area but neither can capture the other's without risking their own stones. In Chinese rules, these points are typically not counted for either player, but the problem statement does not specify how these should be handled. 

In conclusion, while the problem statement is clear and does not contain errors or contradictions, the task it sets out is complex and requires a good understanding of the rules of Weiqi.

To increment the white score when a cell contains a white stone, we can add another if statement inside our nested for loop that checks if the current cell contains a white stone. If it does, we increment the white score by 1.

Here is the Python code for this step:

```python
def score_game(board):
    """
    board: a N-by-N array where each element representing a grid point state using `BLACK`, `WHITE`, or `EMPTY`.
    return a tuple of (black_score, white_score)
    """
    black_score = 0
    white_score = 0

    for row in board:
        for cell in row:
            if cell == BLACK:
                black_score += 1
            elif cell == WHITE:
                white_score += 1
            # Rest of the function will go here

Given the game board state of Weiqi, implement a Python method to calculate the scores of each player using the Chinese
rules for scoring. Use the following declaration:

**Tao >>> said**:

The problem statement seems to be clear and does not contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions. It asks for a Python method to calculate the scores of each player in a game of Weiqi (also known as Go) using the Chinese rules for scoring. The board state is represented as a N-by-N array with each element representing a grid point state using `BLACK`, `WHITE`, or `EMPTY`. The task is to return a tuple of (black_score, white_score). 

However, it's important to note that scoring a game of Weiqi is a complex task that involves more than just counting the number of stones for each player. According to the Chinese rules, the score for a player is the number of stones the player has on the board plus the number of empty points that are completely surrounded by that player's stones. This means that the function will need to implement a way to identify and count these surrounded empty points, which can be a challenging task. 

Additionally, the problem statement does not specify what should be done in case of "seki" situations, where both players have stones in an area but neither can capture the other's without risking their own stones. In Chinese rules, these points are typically not counted for either player, but the problem statement does not specify how these should be handled. 

In conclusion, while the problem statement is clear and does not contain errors or contradictions, the task it sets out is complex and requires a good understanding of the rules of Weiqi.

To increment the white score when a cell contains a white stone, we can add another if statement inside our nested for loop that checks if the current cell contains a white stone. If it does, we increment the white score by 1.

Here is the Python code for this step:

```python
def score_game(board):
    """
    board: a N-by-N array where each element representing a grid point state using `BLACK`, `WHITE`, or `EMPTY`.
    return a tuple of (black_score, white_score)
    """
    black_score = 0
    white_score = 0

    for row in board:
        for cell in row:
            if cell == BLACK:
                black_score += 1
            elif cell == WHITE:
                white_score += 1

To perform a flood fill algorithm to determine whether an empty cell is completely surrounded by stones of one color, we need to implement a helper function. This function will take the coordinates of the cell and the color of the surrounding stones as parameters, and it will recursively check all neighboring cells to see if they are either empty or contain a stone of the specified color. If all neighboring cells meet this condition, the function will return True; otherwise, it will return False.

Here is the Python code for this step:

```python
def score_game(board):
    """
    board: a N-by-N array where each element representing a grid point state using `BLACK`, `WHITE`, or `EMPTY`.
    return a tuple of (black_score, white_score)
    """
    black_score = 0
    white_score = 0

    def is_surrounded_by_color(x, y, color):
        if x < 0 or x >= len(board) or y < 0 or y >= len(board):
            return False
        if board[x][y] == EMPTY:
            board[x][y] = color
            return all(is_surrounded_by_color(x + dx, y + dy, color) for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)])
        return board[x][y] == color

    for i, row in enumerate(board):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == BLACK:
                black_score += 1
            elif cell == WHITE:
                white_score += 1
            elif cell == EMPTY and is_surrounded_by_color(i, j, BLACK):
                black_score += 1
            elif cell == EMPTY and is_surrounded_by_color(i, j, WHITE):
                white_score += 1

    return black_score, white_score
```

In this code, the `is_surrounded_by_color` function uses a depth-first search algorithm to check all neighboring cells. The `all` function is used to ensure that all neighboring cells meet the condition. If any neighboring cell does not meet the condition, the `all` function will return False and the `is_surrounded_by_color` function will also return False. The `is_surrounded_by_color` function is called for each empty cell in the board, and if it returns True, the score for the corresponding color is incremented.

Given the game board state of Weiqi, implement a Python method to calculate the scores of each player using the Chinese
rules for scoring. Use the following declaration:

WHITE = 'W'
EMPTY = None

The problem statement seems to be clear and does not contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions. It asks for a Python method to calculate the scores of each player in a game of Weiqi (also known as Go) using the Chinese rules for scoring. The board state is represented as a N-by-N array with each element representing a grid point state using `BLACK`, `WHITE`, or `EMPTY`. The task is to return a tuple of (black_score, white_score). 

However, it's important to note that scoring a game of Weiqi is a complex task that involves more than just counting the number of stones for each player. According to the Chinese rules, the score for a player is the number of stones the player has on the board plus the number of empty points that are completely surrounded by that player's stones. This means that the function will need to implement a way to identify and count these surrounded empty points, which can be a challenging task. 

Additionally, the problem statement does not specify what should be done in case of "seki" situations, where both players have stones in an area but neither can capture the other's without risking their own stones. In Chinese rules, these points are typically not counted for either player, but the problem statement does not specify how these should be handled. 

In conclusion, while the problem statement is clear and does not contain errors or contradictions, the task it sets out is complex and requires a good understanding of the rules of Weiqi.

To perform a flood fill algorithm to determine whether an empty cell is completely surrounded by stones of one color, we need to implement a helper function. This function will take the coordinates of the cell and the color of the surrounding stones as parameters, and it will recursively check all neighboring cells to see if they are either empty or contain a stone of the specified color. If all neighboring cells meet this condition, the function will return True; otherwise, it will return False.

Here is the Python code for this step:

```python
def score_game(board):
    """
    board: a N-by-N array where each element representing a grid point state using `BLACK`, `WHITE`, or `EMPTY`.
    return a tuple of (black_score, white_score)
    """
    black_score = 0
    white_score = 0

    def is_surrounded_by_color(x, y, color):
        if x < 0 or x >= len(board) or y < 0 or y >= len(board):
            return False
        if board[x][y] == EMPTY:
            board[x][y] = color
            return all(is_surrounded_by_color(x + dx, y + dy, color) for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)])
        return board[x][y] == color

    for i, row in enumerate(board):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == BLACK:
                black_score += 1
            elif cell == WHITE:
                white_score += 1
            elif cell == EMPTY and is_surrounded_by_color(i, j, BLACK):
                black_score += 1
            elif cell == EMPTY and is_surrounded_by_color(i, j, WHITE):
                white_score += 1

    return black_score, white_score
```

In this code, the `is_surrounded_by_color` function uses a depth-first search algorithm to check all neighboring cells. The `all` function is used to ensure that all neighboring cells meet the condition. If any neighboring cell does not meet the condition, the `all` function will return False and the `is_surrounded_by_color` function will also return False. The `is_surrounded_by_color` function is called for each empty cell in the board, and if it returns True, the score for the corresponding color is incremented.

Given the game board state of Weiqi, implement a Python method to calculate the scores of each player using the Chinese
rules for scoring. Use the following declaration:

The problem statement seems to be clear and does not contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions. It asks for a Python method to calculate the scores of each player in a game of Weiqi (also known as Go) using the Chinese rules for scoring. The board state is represented as a N-by-N array with each element representing a grid point state using `BLACK`, `WHITE`, or `EMPTY`. The task is to return a tuple of (black_score, white_score). 

However, it's important to note that scoring a game of Weiqi is a complex task that involves more than just counting the number of stones for each player. According to the Chinese rules, the score for a player is the number of stones the player has on the board plus the number of empty points that are completely surrounded by that player's stones. This means that the function will need to implement a way to identify and count these surrounded empty points, which can be a challenging task. 

Additionally, the problem statement does not specify what should be done in case of "seki" situations, where both players have stones in an area but neither can capture the other's without risking their own stones. In Chinese rules, these points are typically not counted for either player, but the problem statement does not specify how these should be handled. 

In conclusion, while the problem statement is clear and does not contain errors or contradictions, the task it sets out is complex and requires a good understanding of the rules of Weiqi.

If all neighboring cells meet this condition, the function will return True; otherwise, it will return False.

In this code, the `is_surrounded_by_color` function uses a depth-first search algorithm to check all neighboring cells. The `all` function is used to ensure that all neighboring cells meet the condition. If any neighboring cell does not meet the condition, the `all` function will return False and the `is_surrounded_by_color` function will also return False. The `is_surrounded_by_color` function is called for each empty cell in the board, and if it returns True, the score for the corresponding color is incremented.

The final Python function to calculate the scores of each player in a game of Weiqi (also known as Go) using the Chinese rules for scoring is as follows:

```python
BLACK = 'B'
WHITE = 'W'
EMPTY = None

def score_game(board):
    """
    board: a N-by-N array where each element representing a grid point state using `BLACK`, `WHITE`, or `EMPTY`.
    return a tuple of (black_score, white_score)
    """
    black_score = 0
    white_score = 0

    def is_surrounded_by_color(x, y, color):
        if x < 0 or x >= len(board) or y < 0 or y >= len(board):
            return False
        if board[x][y] == EMPTY:
            board[x][y] = color
            return all(is_surrounded_by_color(x + dx, y + dy, color) for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)])
        return board[x][y] == color

    for i, row in enumerate(board):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == BLACK:
                black_score += 1
            elif cell == WHITE:
                white_score += 1
            elif cell == EMPTY and is_surrounded_by_color(i, j, BLACK):
                black_score += 1
            elif cell == EMPTY and is_surrounded_by_color(i, j, WHITE):
                white_score += 1

    return black_score, white_score
```

This function first initializes the scores for black and white to 0. It then iterates over each cell in the board. If a cell contains a black stone, it increments the black score. If a cell contains a white stone, it increments the white score. If a cell is empty, it performs a flood fill algorithm to determine whether it is completely surrounded by stones of one color. If an empty cell is completely surrounded by black stones, it increments the black score. If an empty cell is completely surrounded by white stones, it increments the white score. Finally, it returns the scores for black and white as a tuple.
