***Problem Analysis***



The problem statement does not contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions. However, it lacks specific details that would be necessary to provide a comprehensive solution. For instance, it does not specify the starting location for the journey to Moscow. It also does not specify the mode of transportation to be used (air, land, sea), or any preferences for direct routes versus routes with stops. Without these details, any solution provided would be based on assumptions.
