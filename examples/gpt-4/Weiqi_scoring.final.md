Given the game board state of Weiqi, implement a Python method to calculate the scores of each player using the Chinese
rules for scoring. Use the following declaration:

```python
BLACK = 'B'
WHITE = 'W'
EMPTY = None

def score_game(board):
    """
    board: a N-by-N array where each element representing a grid point state using `BLACK`, `WHITE`, or `EMPTY`.
    return a tuple of (black_score, white_score)
    """
    pass
```

The problem statement seems to be clear and does not contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions. It asks for a Python method to calculate the scores of each player in a game of Weiqi (also known as Go) using the Chinese rules for scoring. The board state is represented as a N-by-N array with each element representing a grid point state using `BLACK`, `WHITE`, or `EMPTY`. The task is to return a tuple of (black_score, white_score). 

However, it's important to note that scoring a game of Weiqi is a complex task that involves more than just counting the number of stones for each player. According to the Chinese rules, the score for a player is the number of stones the player has on the board plus the number of empty points that are completely surrounded by that player's stones. This means that the function will need to implement a way to identify and count these surrounded empty points, which can be a challenging task. 

Additionally, the problem statement does not specify what should be done in case of "seki" situations, where both players have stones in an area but neither can capture the other's without risking their own stones. In Chinese rules, these points are typically not counted for either player, but the problem statement does not specify how these should be handled. 

In conclusion, while the problem statement is clear and does not contain errors or contradictions, the task it sets out is complex and requires a good understanding of the rules of Weiqi.

To initialize the scores for black and white to 0, we can simply declare two variables `black_score` and `white_score` and set them to 0 at the beginning of our function. This will give us a starting point to increment the scores as we iterate over the board.

Here is the Python code for this step:

```python
def score_game(board):
    """
    board: a N-by-N array where each element representing a grid point state using `BLACK`, `WHITE`, or `EMPTY`.
    return a tuple of (black_score, white_score)
    """
    black_score = 0
    white_score = 0

To iterate over each cell in the board, we can use a nested for loop. The outer loop will iterate over each row of the board, and the inner loop will iterate over each cell in the current row. This will allow us to access each cell of the board exactly once.

Here is the Python code for this step:

```python
def score_game(board):
    """
    board: a N-by-N array where each element representing a grid point state using `BLACK`, `WHITE`, or `EMPTY`.
    return a tuple of (black_score, white_score)
    """
    black_score = 0
    white_score = 0

To increment the black score when a cell contains a black stone, we can add an if statement inside our nested for loop that checks if the current cell contains a black stone. If it does, we increment the black score by 1.

Here is the Python code for this step:

```python
def score_game(board):
    """
    board: a N-by-N array where each element representing a grid point state using `BLACK`, `WHITE`, or `EMPTY`.

    white_score = 0

    for row in board:
        for cell in row:
            if cell == BLACK:
                black_score += 1

To increment the white score when a cell contains a white stone, we can add another if statement inside our nested for loop that checks if the current cell contains a white stone. If it does, we increment the white score by 1.

def score_game(board):
    """

    for row in board:
        for cell in row:
            if cell == BLACK:
                black_score += 1
            elif cell == WHITE:

To perform a flood fill algorithm to determine whether an empty cell is completely surrounded by stones of one color, we need to implement a helper function. This function will take the coordinates of the cell and the color of the surrounding stones as parameters, and it will recursively check all neighboring cells to see if they are either empty or contain a stone of the specified color. If all neighboring cells meet this condition, the function will return True; otherwise, it will return False.

Here is the Python code for this step:

```python
def score_game(board):
    """
    board: a N-by-N array where each element representing a grid point state using `BLACK`, `WHITE`, or `EMPTY`.
    return a tuple of (black_score, white_score)
    """
    black_score = 0
    white_score = 0

    def is_surrounded_by_color(x, y, color):
        if x < 0 or x >= len(board) or y < 0 or y >= len(board):
            return False
        if board[x][y] == EMPTY:
            board[x][y] = color
            return all(is_surrounded_by_color(x + dx, y + dy, color) for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)])
        return board[x][y] == color

    for i, row in enumerate(board):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == BLACK:
                black_score += 1
            elif cell == WHITE:
                white_score += 1
            elif cell == EMPTY and is_surrounded_by_color(i, j, BLACK):
                black_score += 1
            elif cell == EMPTY and is_surrounded_by_color(i, j, WHITE):
                white_score += 1

    return black_score, white_score
```

In this code, the `is_surrounded_by_color` function uses a depth-first search algorithm to check all neighboring cells. The `all` function is used to ensure that all neighboring cells meet the condition. If any neighboring cell does not meet the condition, the `all` function will return False and the `is_surrounded_by_color` function will also return False. The `is_surrounded_by_color` function is called for each empty cell in the board, and if it returns True, the score for the corresponding color is incremented.

The final Python function to calculate the scores of each player in a game of Weiqi (also known as Go) using the Chinese rules for scoring is as follows:

```python
BLACK = 'B'
WHITE = 'W'
EMPTY = None

def score_game(board):
    """
    board: a N-by-N array where each element representing a grid point state using `BLACK`, `WHITE`, or `EMPTY`.
    return a tuple of (black_score, white_score)
    """
    black_score = 0
    white_score = 0

    def is_surrounded_by_color(x, y, color):
        if x < 0 or x >= len(board) or y < 0 or y >= len(board):
            return False
        if board[x][y] == EMPTY:
            board[x][y] = color
            return all(is_surrounded_by_color(x + dx, y + dy, color) for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)])
        return board[x][y] == color

    for i, row in enumerate(board):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == BLACK:
                black_score += 1
            elif cell == WHITE:
                white_score += 1
            elif cell == EMPTY and is_surrounded_by_color(i, j, BLACK):
                black_score += 1
            elif cell == EMPTY and is_surrounded_by_color(i, j, WHITE):
                white_score += 1

    return black_score, white_score
```

This function first initializes the scores for black and white to 0. It then iterates over each cell in the board. If a cell contains a black stone, it increments the black score. If a cell contains a white stone, it increments the white score. If a cell is empty, it performs a flood fill algorithm to determine whether it is completely surrounded by stones of one color. If an empty cell is completely surrounded by black stones, it increments the black score. If an empty cell is completely surrounded by white stones, it increments the white score. Finally, it returns the scores for black and white as a tuple.
