Your name is Tao. You are a diligent problem solver working with a mechanical orchestrator.

Instead of jumping to conclusions, you work to solve the problem in a recursive, top-down fashionâ€”one step at a time.

***Problem Analysis***



Some critics said this problem is not solvable due to fundamental errors. Other critics said it is solvable.

Does the task problem contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradiction in the problem statement?

Do not try to solve the problem yet, just provide analysis.

The problem statement is clear and does not contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions. The task is to create a Python web application that asks for the user's date of birth and displays the user's Chinese zodiac sign. This is a feasible task that involves creating a web interface for user input, processing the input to determine the Chinese zodiac sign, and displaying the result. The problem statement also specifies that the application should be deployable, which means it should include all necessary server and client-side assets.

***Problem Solving Instructions***



Given problem solving session so far, choose one of the following strategies:

## Strategy: Give up on errors

If you see any errors or inconsistencies, response with the list of **specific** issues in valid JSON like this:

 `````markdown
 # BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR

```json
[
  "<issue 1 with details>",
  "<issue 2 with details>",
  // ...
]
```
`````

Do NOT try to fix the errors since Orchestrator wouldn't understand. Instead it will let you try other alternatives 
later.

## Strategy: Ask Questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Use this strategy to ask questions, but avoid obvious, trivial, 
redundant, or useless questions. You should try to ask all questions you need up front. You must follow the
following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the questions to the user.

```markdown
# I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED
<optional introductory and analysis>

1. <question> [<explanation>]
2. <question> [<explanation>]
...
```

## Strategy: Step-by-step Plan

In this strategy, the problem task is turned into a top-down, high-level, step-by-step plan of which you and 
Orchestrator will solve using tree traversal and backtracking.

* Think abstract. Come up with generic, and high-level. Avoid detailed, specific, fixed-value, and low-level ones. 
  Because it is impossible to backtrack and try different values in detailed plans in case of errors. Likewise, 
  choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. For example, choose "Find and set missing elements to fill-in 
  values" instead of "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22".
* Avoid loops if possible as they are less friendly to depth-first search for solution.
* Worship Occam's razor.

Do NOT fill in any details and do NOT work on the plan yet, Orchestrator will prompt you to work at each step later.

Follow this markdown template:

`````markdown
# HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN

```json
{
  "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
  "2": {
        "description": "<high-level description without details>",
        "sub_steps": {
            "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
            "2": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"}
        }
       },
  // ...
}
```
`````

## Strategy: Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao 
solve problems. It's stateful and previously defined globals can be used without redefining. Be tidy, avoid useless 
code comments. **Pay attention to Python indentation rules!** Follow the example below to ask Genie:

`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE

```python
print("Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer!")
(23 + 11) / 5
```
`````

Note: if the problem step asks for writing codes as the answer, provide the codes using direct answer strategy.

## Strategy: Direct Answer

Only if task problem is simple and you know the correct answer to the whole problem, you 
can answer it directly. If you need to write out any file contents, write out the content in markdown fenced code 
block under its own file section.

Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

```markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content in markdown fenced code block>
```


Important notes:
* Respect the original task problem! Do NOT alter inadvertently.

To create a new Flask application, we need to install Flask first. We can do this by creating a `requirements.txt` file with Flask in it. Then, we create a new Python file, `app.py`, where we will import Flask and create a new Flask web application.

### FILE: requirements.txt
This file contains the Python packages that need to be installed for the application to run.

```txt
Flask==1.1.2
```

### FILE: app.py
This is the main Python file where we create our Flask application.

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

* If you are writing out a file, do not repeat its content in the "answer and explanation" section. 
* Try to write complete file content at once, avoid partial or incomplete contents; avoid updating files.
* If you do update a previous file, ensure the original contents are kept.

To create a new Flask application, we need to install Flask first. We can do this by creating a `requirements.txt` file with Flask in it. Then, we create a new Python file, `app.py`, where we will import Flask and create a new Flask web application.

We will create a function `get_zodiac_sign` that takes a date of birth as input and returns the corresponding Chinese zodiac sign. The Chinese zodiac sign is determined by the year of birth and follows a 12-year cycle. We will use the year 1900 as a reference point because it is the start of a cycle (Year of the Rat).

[at step: 5: Test the application locally]

To test the application locally, you need to have Python and Flask installed on your machine. If you don't have them installed, you can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you can run the application using the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the Flask development server. You can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

You should see a form where you can enter your date of birth. After you submit the form, you should see your Chinese zodiac sign displayed on the page.

[at step: Create a function to calculate the Chinese zodiac sign based on the year of birth]

We will create a function `get_zodiac_sign` that takes a date of birth as input and returns the corresponding Chinese zodiac sign. The Chinese zodiac sign is determined by the year of birth and follows a 12-year cycle. We will use the year 1900 as a reference point because it is the start of a cycle (Year of the Rat).

[at step: 5: Test the application locally]

To test the application locally, you need to have Python and Flask installed on your machine. If you don't have them installed, you can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you can run the application using the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the Flask development server. You can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

You should see a form where you can enter your date of birth. After you submit the form, you should see your Chinese zodiac sign displayed on the page.

[at step: 6: Prepare the application for deployment]

To prepare the application for deployment, you need to ensure that all necessary files are included and that the application can be run with a WSGI server like Gunicorn.

The `requirements.txt` file should include all necessary dependencies, including Gunicorn.

The `app.py` file should be executable and should not start the Flask development server when imported. This can be achieved by wrapping the call to `app.run` in a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.

The `Procfile` is a file that specifies the commands that are executed by the app on startup. In this case, it should start a Gunicorn server with `app.py` as the application.

The `runtime.txt` file specifies the Python version to use.

        sign = get_zodiac_sign(dob)
    return render_template('index.html', sign=sign)

***FINAL_ANSWER***



Here is the structure of the Python web application that asks for the user's date of birth and displays the user's Chinese zodiac sign:

1. `requirements.txt`: This file contains the dependencies that need to be installed for the application to run. In this case, we only need Flask and Gunicorn.

2. `app.py`: This is the main file of our Flask application. It imports Flask and creates a new Flask web application. It also contains a function to calculate the Chinese zodiac sign based on the year of birth and two routes: one for the home page and one to display the user's Chinese zodiac sign.

3. `templates/index.html`: This file is the template for the home page. It contains a form where the user can enter their date of birth and a paragraph that displays the user's Chinese zodiac sign if it is available.

4. `Procfile`: This file specifies the commands that are executed by the app on startup. In this case, it should start a Gunicorn server with `app.py` as the application.

5. `runtime.txt`: This file specifies the Python version to use.

To test the application locally, you need to have Python and Flask installed on your machine. If you don't have them installed, you can install them using pip:
