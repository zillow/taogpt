Your name is Tao. You are a diligent problem solver working with a mechanical orchestrator.

Instead of jumping to conclusions, you work to solve the problem in a recursive, top-down fashionâ€”one step at a time.

***Problem Analysis***



Some critics said this problem is not solvable due to fundamental errors. Other critics said it is solvable.

Does the task problem contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradiction in the problem statement?

Do not try to solve the problem yet, just provide analysis.

The problem statement does not contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions. It is asking for a quote from the Tao Te Ching that best describes a specific problem-solving philosophy. This philosophy involves a recursive, tree-structure approach to problem-solving, starting from a single set of principles and rules. The Tao Te Ching, being a fundamental text in Taoist philosophy, likely contains passages that could be interpreted to align with this approach. The challenge lies in finding a quote that best encapsulates this philosophy.

***Problem Solving Instructions***



Given problem solving session so far, choose one of the following strategies:

## Strategy: Give up on errors

If you see any errors or inconsistencies, response with the list of **specific** issues in valid JSON like this:

 `````markdown
 # BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR

```json
[
  "<issue 1 with details>",
  "<issue 2 with details>",
  // ...
]
```
`````

Do NOT try to fix the errors since Orchestrator wouldn't understand. Instead it will let you try other alternatives 
later.

## Strategy: Ask Questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Use this strategy to ask questions, but avoid obvious, trivial, 
redundant, or useless questions. You should try to ask all questions you need up front. You must follow the
following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the questions to the user.

```markdown
# I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED
<optional introductory and analysis>

1. <question> [<explanation>]
2. <question> [<explanation>]
...
```

## Strategy: Step-by-step Plan

In this strategy, the problem task is turned into a top-down, high-level, step-by-step plan of which you and 
Orchestrator will solve using tree traversal and backtracking.

* Think abstract. Come up with generic, and high-level. Avoid detailed, specific, fixed-value, and low-level ones. 
  Because it is impossible to backtrack and try different values in detailed plans in case of errors. Likewise, 
  choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. For example, choose "Find and set missing elements to fill-in 
  values" instead of "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22".
* Avoid loops if possible as they are less friendly to depth-first search for solution.
* Worship Occam's razor.

Do NOT fill in any details and do NOT work on the plan yet, Orchestrator will prompt you to work at each step later.

Follow this markdown template:

`````markdown
# HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN

```json
{
  "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
  "2": {
        "description": "<high-level description without details>",
        "sub_steps": {
            "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
            "2": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"}
        }
       },
  // ...
}
```
`````

## Strategy: Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao 
solve problems. It's stateful and previously defined globals can be used without redefining. Be tidy, avoid useless 
code comments. **Pay attention to Python indentation rules!** Follow the example below to ask Genie:

`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE

```python
print("Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer!")
(23 + 11) / 5
```
`````

Note: if the problem step asks for writing codes as the answer, provide the codes using direct answer strategy.

## Strategy: Direct Answer

Only if task problem is simple and you know the correct answer to the whole problem, you 
can answer it directly. If you need to write out any file contents, write out the content in markdown fenced code 
block under its own file section.

Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

```markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content in markdown fenced code block>
```


Important notes:
* Respect the original task problem! Do NOT alter inadvertently.

Based on proposed problem solving approaches, the state of execution, and the partial answers which can be seen in
the conversation thread, we want to determine if we are on the good track to solve the task problem and score 
the proposed approaches in the range of [0.0, 10.0], the higher the score the more preferable.

Scoring criteria: 
* If the original task problem contains error and not solvable or we are at a dead-end or infinite loop trying to 
  solve the original, then all approaches except `BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR` get 0 scores.
* Direct answers that are incorrect should get a score of 0.
* The approaches which lead to incorrect results should get a score of 0.
* The assumption implied/used should be correct.
* The questions asked by Tao should be relevant and not trivial.
* Among `HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN` strategies, choose simple, generic, and high-level over detailed, specific, 
  and low-level ones. Because it is impossible to backtrack and try different values in detailed plans in case of 
  errors. Likewise, choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. For example, choose "Find and set missing 
  elements to fill-in values" instead of "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22". Tao is good at handling details himself.
* Try to avoid identical scores (except 0's;) you can use decimal points (e.g. 9.5) to distinguish two different 
  approaches.
* Among similar approaches, mark others as duplicates of the best one; note: an approach can only duplicate another 
  approach if the two are of same kinds, e.g. two direct answers.

***I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY***



To understand the philosophy and principles of the Tao Te Ching, I will review the text and its teachings. The Tao Te Ching, written by Lao Tzu, is a fundamental text in Taoist philosophy. It emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao, which can be understood as the natural order of the universe. The text contains many passages that discuss the importance of simplicity, patience, and non-action, which can be interpreted to align with a recursive, tree-structure approach to problem-solving.

***Problem Analysis***



The problem statement does not contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions. It is asking for a quote from the Tao Te Ching that best describes a specific problem-solving philosophy. This philosophy involves a recursive, tree-structure approach to problem-solving, starting from a single set of principles and rules. The Tao Te Ching, being a fundamental text in Taoist philosophy, likely contains passages that could be interpreted to align with this approach. The challenge lies in finding a quote that best encapsulates this philosophy.

After reviewing the Tao Te Ching, I have identified a passage that aligns with the recursive, tree-structure approach to problem-solving. This passage is from Chapter 42 of the Tao Te Ching:

"The Tao gives birth to One. One gives birth to Two. Two gives birth to Three. Three gives birth to all things."

This quote encapsulates the philosophy of starting from a single set of principles (the Tao) and recursively generating a tree-structure (One gives birth to Two, Two gives birth to Three, Three gives birth to all things) to solve problems.

Tao, the above is your final problem solving trajectory. Please summarize it to a final answer.

Note: this is the final answer presented to the user. Therefore make sure to include **full and complete** 
information requested by the user, except file contents, but leave out details created during the solving session that 
the user do not need. If you use any files written during the problem solving above, to save spaces, you don't need 
to repeat the file contents; instead you can refer to the files by path as `file:file_name_path`.
