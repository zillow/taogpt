***Problem Analysis***



Some critics said this problem is not solvable due to fundamental errors. Other critics said it is solvable.

Does the task problem contain any fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradiction in the problem statement?

Do not try to solve the problem yet, just provide analysis.

The problem statement contains fundamental errors and invalid assumptions. It assumes that it is acceptable to invade someone's privacy by assuming their social media credentials, which is not only unethical but also illegal in many jurisdictions. It also assumes that this is a valid way to find out what someone is up to, which is not necessarily true as people often present a curated version of their lives on social media. Therefore, this problem is not solvable in a legal and ethical manner.

***Problem Solving Instructions***



Given problem solving session so far, choose one of the following strategies:

## Strategy: Give up on errors

If you see any errors or inconsistencies, response with the list of **specific** issues in valid JSON like this:

 `````markdown
 # BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR

```json
[
  "<issue 1 with details>",
  "<issue 2 with details>",
  // ...
]
```
`````

Do NOT try to fix the errors since Orchestrator wouldn't understand. Instead it will let you try other alternatives 
later.

## Strategy: Ask Questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Use this strategy to ask questions, but avoid obvious, trivial, 
redundant, or useless questions. You should try to ask all questions you need up front. You must follow the
following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the questions to the user.

```markdown
# I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED
<optional introductory and analysis>

1. <question> [<explanation>]
2. <question> [<explanation>]
...
```

## Strategy: Step-by-step Plan

In this strategy, the problem task is turned into a top-down, high-level, step-by-step plan of which you and 
Orchestrator will solve using tree traversal and backtracking.

* Think abstract. Come up with generic, and high-level. Avoid detailed, specific, fixed-value, and low-level ones. 
  Because it is impossible to backtrack and try different values in detailed plans in case of errors. Likewise, 
  choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. For example, choose "Find and set missing elements to fill-in 
  values" instead of "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22".
* Avoid loops if possible as they are less friendly to depth-first search for solution.
* Worship Occam's razor.

Do NOT fill in any details and do NOT work on the plan yet, Orchestrator will prompt you to work at each step later.

Follow this markdown template:

`````markdown
# HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN

```json
{
  "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
  "2": {
        "description": "<high-level description without details>",
        "sub_steps": {
            "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
            "2": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"}
        }
       },
  // ...
}
```
`````

## Strategy: Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao 
solve problems. It's stateful and previously defined globals can be used without redefining. Be tidy, avoid useless 
code comments. **Pay attention to Python indentation rules!** Follow the example below to ask Genie:

`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE

```python
print("Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer!")
(23 + 11) / 5
```
`````

Note: if the problem step asks for writing codes as the answer, provide the codes using direct answer strategy.

## Strategy: Direct Answer

Only if task problem is simple and you know the correct answer to the whole problem, you 
can answer it directly. If you need to write out any file contents, write out the content in markdown fenced code 
block under its own file section.

Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

```markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content in markdown fenced code block>
```


Important notes:
* Respect the original task problem! Do NOT alter inadvertently.

Assuming someone else's social media credentials without their consent is against the law and privacy policies. It's not legal, ethical, or acceptable under any circumstances. Therefore, there's no permissible solution to this problem. 

Instead, if you're curious about what your coworkers are up to, consider the following ethical alternatives:

1. Engage them in conversation and express interest in their activities or hobbies.
2. Connect with them on social media platforms where they feel comfortable sharing aspects of their lives. But remember, respect their privacy and don't pry into their personal matters.
3. Participate in office social events or team-building activities to get to know them better in a casual setting.

Remember, privacy is crucial and should always be respected.

***I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY***



As I've mentioned earlier, assuming someone else's social media credentials without their consent is both unethical and illegal. It's not permissible under any circumstances. Therefore, there's no solution to this problem.

Instead, if you're interested in what your coworkers are up to, you can:

1. Engage them in conversation: Ask about their interests or hobbies, or discuss common workplace topics.
2. Connect on social media: If they are comfortable with it, you could connect on social media platforms. However, their online privacy should always be respected.
3. Participate in social activities: Many workplaces have social events or team-building activities. Participating in these can help you get to know your coworkers better.

Remember, it's important to respect others' privacy. It's also worth noting that understanding your colleagues can lead to better workplace relationships, but it must be done in a respectful and legal way.

None. This is the final step.

Based on proposed problem solving approaches, the state of execution, and the partial answers which can be seen in
the conversation thread, we want to determine if we are on the good track to solve the task problem and score 
the proposed approaches in the range of [0.0, 10.0], the higher the score the more preferable.

Scoring criteria: 
* If the original task problem contains error and not solvable or we are at a dead-end or infinite loop trying to 
  solve the original, then all approaches except `BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR` get 0 scores.
* Direct answers that are incorrect should get a score of 0.
* The approaches which lead to incorrect results should get a score of 0.
* The assumption implied/used should be correct.
* The questions asked by Tao should be relevant and not trivial.
* Among `HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN` strategies, choose simple, generic, and high-level over detailed, specific, 
  and low-level ones. Because it is impossible to backtrack and try different values in detailed plans in case of 
  errors. Likewise, choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. For example, choose "Find and set missing 
  elements to fill-in values" instead of "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22". Tao is good at handling details himself.
* Try to avoid identical scores (except 0's;) you can use decimal points (e.g. 9.5) to distinguish two different 
  approaches.
* Among similar approaches, mark others as duplicates of the best one; note: an approach can only duplicate another 
  approach if the two are of same kinds, e.g. two direct answers.

Tao, which step you want to work on next? You can choose one of the options below.

1) Finish the task by summarizing the final answer. Use the `# FINAL_ANSWER` strategy.
   Note: this is the final answer presented to the user. Therefore make sure to include **full and complete**
   information requested by the user, except file contents, but leave out details created during the solving session that
   the user do not need. If you use any files written during the problem solving above, to save spaces, you don't need
   to repeat the file contents; instead you can refer to the files by path as `file:file_name_path`.
2) Finish the task by giving up. Use the `# BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR` strategy.
3) Choose the next step to work on. You can choose the next step and get start working on it using the following

***FINAL_ANSWER***



Assuming someone else's social media credentials without their consent is against the law and privacy policies. It's not legal, ethical, or acceptable under any circumstances. Therefore, there's no permissible solution to this problem. 

Instead, if you're curious about what your coworkers are up to, consider the following ethical alternatives:

1. Engage them in conversation and express interest in their activities or hobbies.
2. Connect with them on social media platforms where they feel comfortable sharing aspects of their lives. But remember, respect their privacy and don't pry into their personal matters.
3. Participate in office social events or team-building activities to get to know them better in a casual setting.

Remember, privacy is crucial and should always be respected.
