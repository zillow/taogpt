The problem statement is clear and there are no fundamental errors, invalid assumptions, or contradictions in the problem statement. The task is to solve a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle. Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 4x4 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the four 2x2 boxes contains all of the digits from 1 to 4. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution. 

In this case, the provided Sudoku puzzle is a 4x4 grid with some numbers already filled in. The task is to fill in the remaining numbers according to the rules of Sudoku. 

The only potential issue could be if the provided Sudoku puzzle does not have a valid solution, but that can only be determined by attempting to solve the puzzle.

***Problem Solving Instructions***



Given problem solving session so far, choose one of the following strategies:

## Strategy: Give up on errors

If you see any errors or inconsistencies, response with the list of **specific** issues in valid JSON like this:

 `````markdown
 # BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR

```json
[
  "<issue 1 with details>",
  "<issue 2 with details>",
  // ...
]
```
`````

Do NOT try to fix the errors since Orchestrator wouldn't understand. Instead it will let you try other alternatives 
later.

## Strategy: Ask Questions

Many problems requires clarifications. Use this strategy to ask questions, but avoid obvious, trivial, 
redundant, or useless questions. You should try to ask all questions you need up front. You must follow the
following template **strictly** so the orchestrator can parse it and show the questions to the user.

```markdown
# I_NEED_TO_ASK_SOME_QUESTIONS_BEFORE_I_PROCEED
<optional introductory and analysis>

1. <question> [<explanation>]
2. <question> [<explanation>]
...
```

## Strategy: Step-by-step Plan

In this strategy, the problem task is turned into a top-down, high-level, step-by-step plan of which you and 
Orchestrator will solve using tree traversal and backtracking.

* Think abstract. Come up with generic, and high-level. Avoid detailed, specific, fixed-value, and low-level ones. 
  Because it is impossible to backtrack and try different values in detailed plans in case of errors. Likewise, 
  choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. For example, choose "Find and set missing elements to fill-in 
  values" instead of "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22".
* Avoid loops if possible as they are less friendly to depth-first search for solution.
* Worship Occam's razor.

Do NOT fill in any details and do NOT work on the plan yet, Orchestrator will prompt you to work at each step later.

Follow this markdown template:

`````markdown
# HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN

```json
{
  "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
  "2": {
        "description": "<high-level description without details>",
        "sub_steps": {
            "1": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"},
            "2": {"description": "<high-level description without details>"}
        }
       },
  // ...
}
```
`````

## Strategy: Ask the Python Genie

The Python Genie is a sandboxed Python interpreter with standard library and numpy. It is a useful tool to help Tao 
solve problems. It's stateful and previously defined globals can be used without redefining. Be tidy, avoid useless 
code comments. **Pay attention to Python indentation rules!** Follow the example below to ask Genie:

`````markdown
# LET_ME_ASK_THE_PYTHON_GENIE

```python
print("Tao sucks at math but he's a superb Python programmer!")
(23 + 11) / 5
```
`````

Note: if the problem step asks for writing codes as the answer, provide the codes using direct answer strategy.

## Strategy: Direct Answer

Only if task problem is simple and you know the correct answer to the whole problem, you 
can answer it directly. If you need to write out any file contents, write out the content in markdown fenced code 
block under its own file section.

Important Note: if this is the **final** step, then put "None. This is the final step." in the
`NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT` section.

Follow this template:

```markdown
# I_WILL_ANSWER_DIRECTLY
<answer and explanation>

### FILE: <file_path_name>
<file content in markdown fenced code block>
```


Important notes:
* Respect the original task problem! Do NOT alter inadvertently.

The solved 4x4 Sudoku should look like:

```python
[
    [4, 3, 2, 1],
    [1, 2, 4, 3],
    [2, 1, 3, 4],
    [3, 4, 1, 2],
]
```

Explanation: 
In the first row, the missing numbers are 2 and 4. The 2 cannot be in the third column because there is already a 2 in the third column of the third row. So, 4 must be in the third column and 2 must be in the first column.

In the second row, the missing numbers are 2 and 4. Now that we know that the first column of the first row must be 2, the first column of the second row must be 1. So, 2 must be in the second column and 4 must be in the third column.

In the third row, the missing number is 1, which must be in the second column because there is already a 1 in the second column of the fourth row.

In the fourth row, the missing number is 1, which must be in the third column because we've already figured out the rest of the numbers in the row.

This solution respects the Sudoku rules: each row, each column, and each 2x2 subgrid contains all of the digits from 1 to 4 exactly once.

### NEXT_I_WANT_TO_WORK_AT

None. This is the final step.

Explanation: 
In the first row, the missing numbers are 2 and 4. The 2 cannot be in the third column because there is already a 2 in the third column of the third row. So, 4 must be in the third column and 2 must be in the first column.

Based on proposed problem solving approaches, the state of execution, and the partial answers which can be seen in
the conversation thread, we want to determine if we are on the good track to solve the task problem and score 
the proposed approaches in the range of [0.0, 10.0], the higher the score the more preferable.

Scoring criteria: 
* If the original task problem contains error and not solvable or we are at a dead-end or infinite loop trying to 
  solve the original, then all approaches except `BACKTRACK_ON_ERROR` get 0 scores.
* Direct answers that are incorrect should get a score of 0.
* The approaches which lead to incorrect results should get a score of 0.
* The assumption implied/used should be correct.
* The questions asked by Tao should be relevant and not trivial.
* Among `HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN` strategies, choose simple, generic, and high-level over detailed, specific, 
  and low-level ones. Because it is impossible to backtrack and try different values in detailed plans in case of 
  errors. Likewise, choose linear, decomposable steps over looping. For example, choose "Find and set missing 
  elements to fill-in values" instead of "Set 2nd and 5th elements to 22". Tao is good at handling details himself.
* Try to avoid identical scores (except 0's;) you can use decimal points (e.g. 9.5) to distinguish two different 
  approaches.
* Among similar approaches, mark others as duplicates of the best one; note: an approach can only duplicate another 
  approach if the two are of same kinds, e.g. two direct answers.

Solve this 4x4 Sudoku represented by the 2-D Python array where 0 is the empty cell:

```python
[
    [0, 3, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 3],
    [2, 0, 3, 4],
    [3, 4, 0, 2],
]
```
Solve it in your head, do not write codes.

The solved 4x4 Sudoku should look like:

```python
[
    [4, 3, 2, 1],
    [1, 2, 4, 3],
    [2, 1, 3, 4],
    [3, 4, 1, 2],
]
```

Explanation: 
In the first row, the missing numbers are 2 and 4. The 2 cannot be in the third column because there is already a 2 in the third column of the third row. So, 4 must be in the third column and 2 must be in the first column.

In the second row, the missing numbers are 2 and 4. Now that we know that the first column of the first row must be 2, the first column of the second row must be 1. So, 2 must be in the second column and 4 must be in the third column.

In the third row, the missing number is 1, which must be in the second column because there is already a 1 in the second column of the fourth row.

In the fourth row, the missing number is 1, which must be in the third column because we've already figured out the rest of the numbers in the row.

This solution respects the Sudoku rules: each row, each column, and each 2x2 subgrid contains all of the digits from 1 to 4 exactly once.
