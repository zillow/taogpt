1. The route plan should start from the requester's current location.
2. The route plan should end in Moscow.
3. The route plan should include all necessary transit points (airports, train stations, etc.).
4. The route plan should consider the most efficient and practical routes.
5. The route plan should provide alternatives, if possible, to accommodate any changes or preferences.
6. The route plan should not include the booking details as per the requester's preference.
