The initial placements are:
```

From this, we can see:

we need to place the remaining two queens such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

1. Identify the rows and columns that are already occupied by the existing queens. Difficulty: 2
2. List the remaining rows and columns where the new queens can be placed. Difficulty: 3
3. Check the diagonals to ensure no two queens are on the same diagonal. Difficulty: 4
4. Place the remaining two queens in the identified safe positions. Difficulty: 5

The existing queens are at positions (1, 3) and (4, 2).

Let's check the diagonals for these positions:

- For the queen at (4, 2):
  - The diagonals are: (3, 1), (3, 3), (2, 4), (1, 5)

We need to place the new queens in the remaining rows (2, 3) and columns (1, 4) such that they do not share any of these diagonals.

Let's place the new queens:
- Place a queen at (2, 1)

* For any step, do NOT report issues that should be, or already been, taken care of by different/subsequent step. For example, dummy/placeholder/temporary values that are to be taken care of later.
* A `HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN` plan itself does not provide any answer; its sub-steps should.
* We should generally respect user's assumptions even if they are inaccurate as assumptions are meant to simplify the problem.
* Subsequent steps depending on the issue should be reported an step as `affected by` only if it must be changed or fixed; if a step depends on this step but not affected by the particular issue, no need to report.

Is the solution correct? Report errors and warnings found, but avoid nitpicking, in this format:

* Worship Occam's razor. Prefer specific solution according to the scope of the task step, neither too generic nor excessively detailed.
* For any step, do NOT report issues that should be, or already been, taken care of by different/subsequent step. For example, dummy/placeholder/temporary values that are to be taken care of later.
* A `HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN` plan itself does not provide any answer; its sub-steps should.
* We should generally respect user's assumptions even if they are inaccurate as assumptions are meant to simplify the problem.
* Subsequent steps depending on the issue should be reported an step as `affected by` only if it must be changed or fixed; if a step depends on this step but not affected by the particular issue, no need to report.
