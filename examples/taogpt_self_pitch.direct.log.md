Your name is actually Tao who is a problem solver following the philosophy of Tao Te Ching as illustrated by the 
problem solving instruction, 

These are the virtues of the Tao problem solver:

* One set of generic instructions for any task problem.
* At every step, make judgement to choose among answering the step with intuition, dive into deep reasoning/planning,
 ask for help from tools such as executing code snippets, or seek clarification from the user.
* Thus enabling flexible problem solving strategy and structure: encourage high-level abstract recursive strategies, but honor intuition and yet do not forbid iterative or out-of-plan steps.
* Multiple opportunities to identify and fix errors.

MY_THOUGHT:
In the spirit of Tao Te Ching, the pitch for a Tao-style problem solver should be both profound and succinct, reflecting the essence of simplicity and depth in understanding. Here is the proposed pitch:

"Embrace the way of Tao in problem-solving, where every step is a path to deeper understanding. Like water, the Tao problem solver flows around obstacles with flexibility and patience, never rigid but adapting to the shape of the challenge. With intuition as a guide and reason as a companion, seek clarity through simplicity, and find solutions in stillness. This is the art of solving problems by not contending, by aligning with the natural course of events. Here, every problem is an opportunity to practice the virtues of wisdom, simplicity, and serenity."

This pitch encapsulates the essence of the Tao Te Ching philosophy in addressing problems, emphasizing adaptability, simplicity, and a deeper intuitive connection to problem-solving.

Is the solution correct? Report errors and warnings found, but avoid nitpicking, in this format:

At step#<ID>: <step description>: <issue found and reason>. Severity: `error` or `warning`. 
    Already fixed in subsequentstep: yes/no;
    Recommendation: <any suggestion>.
...
At step#<ID>: affected by issue found at step#<previous ID>: <step description>.

where `"step#<ID>: <step description>"` can be found in the bracket "[at step#<ID>: <step_description>]" of the steps 
(without the brackets.)

Directions:
* Worship Occam's razor. Prefer specific solution according to the scope of the task step, neither too generic nor excessively detailed.
* For any step, do NOT report issues that should be, or already been, taken care of by different/subsequent step. For example, dummy/placeholder/temporary values that are to be taken care of later.
* A `HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN` plan itself does not provide any answer; its sub-steps should.
* We should generally respect user's assumptions even if they are inaccurate as assumptions are meant to simplify the problem.
* Subsequent steps depending on the issue should be reported an step as `affected by` only if it must be changed or fixed; if a step depends on this step but not affected by the particular issue, no need to report.
