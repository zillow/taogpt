***Intuition-Driven Deep Planning and Reasoning with Large Language Models***



## Introduction

In the realm of artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing and generating human-like text based on extensive training on diverse datasets. These models excel in tasks that require quick, intuitive responses and basic reasoning, akin to human System 1 thinking. However, their performance in tasks demanding deep analytical thinking, complex planning, and advanced reasoning—attributes of human System 2 thinking—remains an area ripe for exploration and enhancement.

The research presented in this paper introduces the Template-guided Autoregressive Orchestrator for General Problem Tackling (TaoGPT), an innovative approach designed to extend the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs into the realm of complex, System 2 tasks. TaoGPT leverages the intrinsic strengths of LLMs while addressing their limitations in handling tasks that require structured planning and detailed reasoning. This is achieved through a combination of strategic prompt engineering and role-based task execution, where the LLM assumes dual roles: Tao, the problem solver, and Sage, the critic.

This paper details the methodology behind TaoGPT, emphasizing its dual-process framework which integrates planning and execution with self-critique, error detection, and iterative improvement. The system's architecture is designed to foster a deep, intuitive engagement with problems, enabling the LLM to navigate through tasks with a level of sophistication that mimics human problem-solving processes. Through the innovative use of self-hinting techniques and the TRIPS (Targeted Repair, Improvement, and Partial Summarization) error correction mechanism, TaoGPT aims to refine the problem-solving journey, thereby enhancing the output quality and reliability of LLMs in complex scenarios.

The following sections will delve into the specific processes and mechanisms that constitute TaoGPT, illustrating how this approach stands to redefine the capabilities of LLMs in advanced problem-solving tasks.

MY_THOUGHT:
The introduction of the research paper on "Intuition-Driven Deep Planning and Reasoning with Large Language Models" should focus on presenting a clear, unbiased overview of the core concepts and innovations without promotional language. Here is a suggested draft for the introductory section:

---

In recent advancements in artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown considerable success in tasks that mimic human-like textual interactions. These models, trained on vast textual datasets, excel primarily in applications requiring rapid responses and fundamental reasoning, characteristic of what cognitive science refers to as System 1 cognitive functions. However, their capabilities in handling complex, analytical tasks that necessitate advanced planning and deep reasoning—akin to System 2 cognitive processes—remain underdeveloped.

This paper introduces the Template-guided Autoregressive Orchestrator for General Problem Tackling (TaoGPT), a novel framework designed to enhance the problem-solving abilities of LLMs in tackling System 2 type tasks. TaoGPT integrates strategic prompt engineering with a dual-role functionality approach, where the model alternates between being a problem solver (Tao) and a critical analyzer (Sage). This design aims to utilize the inherent strengths of LLMs while effectively addressing their limitations in managing complex, structured tasks.

The methodology section of this paper outlines the dual-process system of TaoGPT, which combines direct problem-solving with a continuous self-critique and iterative enhancement process. This system is structured to promote a deeper, more intuitive engagement with problems, allowing the LLM to navigate complex tasks with heightened sophistication and reliability. By incorporating mechanisms such as self-hinting and the TRIPS (Targeted Repair, Improvement, and Partial Summarization) methodology, TaoGPT seeks to improve the precision and effectiveness of LLMs in sophisticated problem-solving scenarios.

The subsequent sections will detail the specific processes and operational mechanics of TaoGPT, demonstrating the potential of this approach to expand the problem-solving capacities of LLMs significantly.

The introduction of the research paper on "Intuition-Driven Deep Planning and Reasoning with Large Language Models" should focus on presenting a clear, unbiased overview of the core concepts and innovations without promotional language. Here is a suggested draft for the introductory section:

---

In recent advancements in artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown considerable success in tasks that mimic human-like textual interactions. These models, trained on vast textual datasets, excel primarily in applications requiring rapid responses and fundamental reasoning, characteristic of what cognitive science refers to as System 1 cognitive functions. However, their capabilities in handling complex, analytical tasks that necessitate advanced planning and deep reasoning—akin to System 2 cognitive processes—remain underdeveloped.

This paper introduces the Template-guided Autoregressive Orchestrator for General Problem Tackling (TaoGPT), a novel framework designed to enhance the problem-solving abilities of LLMs in tackling System 2 type tasks. TaoGPT integrates strategic prompt engineering with a dual-role functionality approach, where the model alternates between being a problem solver (Tao) and a critical analyzer (Sage). This design aims to utilize the inherent strengths of LLMs while effectively addressing their limitations in managing complex, structured tasks.

The methodology section of this paper outlines the dual-process system of TaoGPT, which combines direct problem-solving with a continuous self-critique and iterative enhancement process. This system is structured to promote a deeper, more intuitive engagement with problems, allowing the LLM to navigate complex tasks with heightened sophistication and reliability. By incorporating mechanisms such as self-hinting and the TRIPS (Targeted Repair, Improvement, and Partial Summarization) methodology, TaoGPT seeks to improve the precision and effectiveness of LLMs in sophisticated problem-solving scenarios.

The subsequent sections will detail the specific processes and operational mechanics of TaoGPT, demonstrating the potential of this approach to expand the problem-solving capacities of LLMs significantly.

Is the solution correct? Report errors and warnings found, but avoid nitpicking, in this format:

At step#<ID>: <step description>: <issue found and reason>. Severity: `error` or `warning`. 
    Already fixed in subsequentstep: yes/no;

Directions:
* Worship Occam's razor. Prefer specific solution according to the scope of the task step, neither too generic nor excessively detailed.
* For any step, do NOT report issues that should be, or already been, taken care of by different/subsequent step. For example, dummy/placeholder/temporary values that are to be taken care of later.
* A `HERE_IS_MY_STEP_BY_STEP_PLAN` plan itself does not provide any answer; its sub-steps should.
* We should generally respect user's assumptions even if they are inaccurate as assumptions are meant to simplify the problem.
* Subsequent steps depending on the issue should be reported an step as `affected by` only if it must be changed or fixed; if a step depends on this step but not affected by the particular issue, no need to report.

The introduction to the research paper on "Intuition-Driven Deep Planning and Reasoning with Large Language Models" should succinctly present the fundamental concepts and features of the proposed Template-guided Autoregressive Orchestrator for General Problem Tackling (TaoGPT) without promotional language. Here is a revised draft for the introductory section:

---

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have spotlighted the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in tasks that involve human-like textual interactions. These models are adept in applications requiring quick responses and basic reasoning, aligning with System 1 cognitive functions. However, their performance in complex tasks demanding in-depth planning and intricate reasoning—related to System 2 cognitive processes—has been less effective.

This paper introduces the Template-guided Autoregressive Orchestrator for General Problem Tackling (TaoGPT), a framework aimed at enhancing the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs for these more demanding tasks. TaoGPT employs a dual-role functionality, alternating between a problem solver (Tao) and a critical analyzer (Sage), to harness the intrinsic strengths of LLMs while addressing their limitations in structured task management.

The methodology section will delve into TaoGPT's dual-process system, which integrates direct problem-solving with a self-critique and iterative enhancement cycle. This approach is designed to deepen the engagement of LLMs with complex problems, thereby improving their ability to navigate through tasks that require sophisticated planning and reasoning. The incorporation of self-hinting techniques and the TRIPS (Targeted Repair, Improvement, and Partial Summarization) methodology further aims to refine the accuracy and effectiveness of LLMs in complex problem-solving scenarios.

Detailed discussions in subsequent sections will outline the specific processes and operational mechanics of TaoGPT, demonstrating its potential to significantly broaden the problem-solving capacities of LLMs.
